Trump Outlines Plan to Lower Drug Prices
WASHINGTON — President Trump vowed on Friday to “derail the gravy train for special interests” as he outlined a strategy intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs by promoting tougher negotiation, more competition and measures to stop foreign countries from taking advantage of American industry.

Mr. Trump said the current system has been corrupted by greedy businesses and middlemen who have made “an absolute fortune” through “dishonest double-dealing” at the expense of consumers who need medicine to extend or improve their lives.

“Everyone involved in the broken system — the drug makers, insurance companies, distributors, pharmacy benefit managers and many others — contribute to the problem,” he said in a speech in the Rose Garden. “Government has also been part of the problem because previous leaders turned a blind eye to this incredible abuse. But under this administration we are putting American patients first.”

Mr. Trump’s plan, however, is a break from what he promised on the campaign trail. It does not authorize the government to use its huge purchasing power to obtain lower prices by negotiating directly with drug manufacturers. Nor does it expand the ability of American consumers to import low-cost prescriptions from abroad.
