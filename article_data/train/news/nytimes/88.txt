Airbnb Sets Its Sights on Surfing
It was the W.S.L. organization that tipped off Airbnb that many surfers were fans of the company’s rentals. The chief executive of the league, Sophie Goldschmidt, said that surfers prefer to stay in homes versus hotels and frequently book their stays through Airbnb. “When you have a big surfboard, it’s easier to stay in a house, and many top surfing destinations don’t have a lot of hotels anyway,” she said.

Ms. Goldschmidt also said that the surfers hosting the Experience s are an integral part of W.S.L.’s community and have been vetted by the organization. The activities they are offering on Airbnb range from surfing lessons to surfing photo tours to surfing adventures in the ocean .

In Biarritz, France, which is one of Europe’s premier surfing destinations, two brothers who are former W.S.L. competitors, Edouard and Antoine Delpero, are offering longboarding lessons through their Delpero Surf Experience. In New York, the well-known big wave surfer Will Skudin will offer surfing lessons in Rockaway Beach, Queens. In Haleiwa, Hawaii, on the North Shore of Oahu, the renowned surfboard shaper Carl Schaper will teach guests how to cut foam to create their own surfboard. Most of the surfing activities can be customized for guests to take into account their level of expertise.

Mr. Chesky himself is a novice surfer but said that he enjoyed the sport when he tried it last year in Cape Town, South Africa, by booking the Surf with a Purpose Experience, where he took a two-hour surf lesson in Muizenberg Beach with the surfer Apish Tshetsha and also learned about the surf therapy that he provides for free to low-income children. “It was then that I realized that surfing is an exciting sport even if you’re just trying it once in a while,” he said.

Airbnb isn’t the only player in the travel industry that’s paying more attention to surfing: several hotels, too, are introducing or have recently launched surfing experiences for guests.
