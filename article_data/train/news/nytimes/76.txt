The Sistine Chapel of Comic-Strip Art
In a dark booth at the Overlook, which resides in a little brick building that has defied demolition below the skyscrapers of East Midtown, two men were having a beer. The bar was rowdy with people eating wings and watching basketball on televisions, but the men were busy studying the cracked, aging wall beside them. Twenty feet wide and spanning the room’s length, it was covered with dozens of fading drawings of classic American cartoon and comic strip characters.

“There’s Dagwood and Bullwinkle over there,” said Steve Gold, 57, pointing out familiar faces. “That’s Beetle Bailey and Hagar the Horrible.”

“And there’s Fred Flintstone,” said his friend, Marcel Alers.

“I grew up with all this,” Mr. Gold added. “My kids are in their 20s and probably have no clue who these characters even are. This is my childhood.” The crowds remained focused on the glowing television screens and the Buffalo wings.
