Chewy, Fruity Candy
You might remember, as I did, that the “Groundbreaking 1990s sitcom” was ELLEN DeGeneres’s show. Connect that with STIFFED at 1D and you’ve opened up a whole section for yourself in the northwest. If you can solve most of that, you could branch out. I’ll help, although you probably are way ahead of me: a Zippo’s output is a FLAME.

That’s a good start, but now it’s time to start spreading out. Let’s see what we can connect and build upon.

My gaze fell upon the center of the puzzle, with its “Chewy, fruity candy.” Please note, as I did, that the entry has the same number of letters as the candy STARBURST, and yet that is not the correct answer, at least not today. It could also be JELLY BEAN, but you weren’t fooled by that clue “Digs in the snow” and knew it was “digs” as in a home, right? Of course you did. You had IGLOO in there the whole time. See? Those entries you can solve are in there, if you break down the clue list.

So, today, the candy is the equally delicious GUMMY BEAR, although if you decide to partake while solving, for the love of God, please check your bag and make sure you are not eating the Haribo sugar-free ones, because that will totally ruin your solving time. You don’t believe me? Read these Amazon product reviews. Or don’t, especially if you are eating as you read this column.

I’m sorry, I drifted. My point is, even if you don’t recognize anything the first time you scan the clue list for gimmes, hang in there. You’ll see it, even if you have to pore over the list a few times. UMA saved me today, maybe JOSEPH of the nativity scene at 58A will save you. And then, like a lot of things in life, it’s all about building bridges.
