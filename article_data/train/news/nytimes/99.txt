How to Make a Crossword Puzzle
DEB AMLEN: In Part 1 of “How to Make a Crossword Puzzle,” the puzzle makers Ben Tausig and Finn Vigeland developed a theme for a crossword puzzle by bouncing ideas back and forth until a cohesive set that follows the rules of constructing came together.

Their fellow constructors, David Steinberg and Natan Last, pick up where Mr. Tausig and Mr. Vigeland left off to demonstrate the next step in making a crossword puzzle: setting the theme entries in a blank crossword grid and placing the black squares. Just as in theme development, there is a lot of trial and error. The goal is to place the theme entries and black squares in such a way as to get the best chance of filling the puzzle with sparkling, lively nontheme entries.

That is Mr. Steinberg’s and Mr. Last’s challenge. Let’s watch them work it out.

DAVID STEINBERG: I’d say grid design is the hardest part of the construction process to get the hang of, but we believe in all the aspiring constructors out there! All it takes is a few guiding principles and lots of practice.

NATAN LAST: Wait, practice? I thought we just plug our lovely theme answers into a piece of software and, voilà, a beautiful crossword emerges.
