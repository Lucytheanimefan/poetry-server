7 Are Killed in Australia’s Worst Mass Shooting Since 1996
PERTH, Australia — Seven people, including four children, were found dead from gunshot wounds at a rural property in Western Australia on Friday, the police said, in what appeared to be the country’s worst mass shooting in more than 20 years.

The police were called just after 5 a.m. on Friday to the home of Cynda and Peter Miles in Osmington, a village near the tourist town of Margaret River, 170 miles south of Perth. There they discovered the victims, three adults and four children.

The police have yet to publicly identify the bodies. They said they were not pursuing a suspect, but would not confirm a murder-suicide.

Crime-scene and homicide detectives traveled from Perth to investigate.

South West Superintendent Mick Sutherland, the most senior police officer in the region, said on Friday that the property was a crime scene “and we’ve got to figure out what happened.” He said the police expected to be on the site for up to five days.
