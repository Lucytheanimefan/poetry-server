Lamb Stew, Now Lighter and Brighter
Sometimes making dinner is an exercise in spontaneity. You may have certain ingredients on hand and a general notion of the outcome, but not necessarily a plan for getting there.

That’s part of the fun of cooking: leaving room for spur-of-the-moment ideas, or even a shift in direction.

I had a nice boneless lamb shoulder roast, and first thought of steaming it to tenderness in the Moroccan style and eating it with harissa oil, toasted crushed cumin and coarse salt. Or I could have prepared it in a more French manner, studding it with garlic, rubbing it with rosemary and thyme and roasting it medium-rare. It’s an easy dinner, and the shoulder roast, to me, is tastier than the leaner and pricier hind leg.

What I really wanted, though, was something brothy and stewlike. I appreciate soups, stews and braises year-round, but warmer weather calls for a lighter approach.
