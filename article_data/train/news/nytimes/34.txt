Subscribe to the Gender Letter Newsletter
Welcome to Gender Letter — a weekly take on news, trends, culture and whatever else is on the mind of our gender editor, Jessica Bennett.

Each newsletter consists of an editor’s note and an examination of the week’s top stories (through a gender-centric lens, of course). We also break down the notable numbers that appear in our articles, highlight the voices of female figures and dive into the Times archives to examine our past coverage.
