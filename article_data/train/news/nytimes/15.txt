‘Harry Potter’ Director’s 5 Influences: Kate Bush, Tennessee Williams and More
Fans of the director John Tiffany know that “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” is only his latest bit of sorcery.

Since he marched onto the scene a decade or so ago with the dazzling “Black Watch,” he has also given us a decadent “Bacchae,” a swoony “Once,” a robustly lyrical “The Glass Menagerie” and a coolly feverish “Let the Right One In.”

There are some differences this time: He’s working on an enormous scale (“Cursed Child” is capitalized for Broadway at a Gringotts-busting $35.5 million) and he’s not only the play’s director. In collaboration with J.K. Rowling, the author of the novels, and Jack Thorne, who wrote the script, he dreamed up the story, which imagines a Harry aged from boy wizard to dad wizard. The show was nominated for 10 Tony Awards, one of them recognizing Mr. Tiffany’s emotive, cape-swirling direction.

On a break from rehearsing a new London cast for the show, Mr. Tiffany, 46, spoke about his influences. First and foremost: “People, really, because at the end of the day, who are you if not the people that surrounded you, influenced you, challenged you, angered you, made you furious with pleasure and joy and lust?” Many of his “Cursed Child” colleagues are friends he has known and worked with for decades.
