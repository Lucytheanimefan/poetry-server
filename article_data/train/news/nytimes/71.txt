Scott Hutchison, Frightened Rabbit Singer, Is Found Dead at 36
Scott Hutchison, the lead singer and songwriter of the Scottish folk-rock band Frightened Rabbit, was found dead on Thursday near South Queensferry, Scotland, the Edinburgh police confirmed, after a days-long search for the musician, who was said to be in a “fragile state.”

The police could not immediately identify a cause of death, but said it was not being treated as suspicious.

Mr. Hutchison, 36, had not been seen since the early morning hours on Wednesday, when he left a hotel in South Queensferry after sending two cryptic messages on Twitter. He wrote: “Be so good to everyone you love. It’s not a given. I’m so annoyed that it’s not. I didn’t live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones,” and “I’m away now. Thanks.”
