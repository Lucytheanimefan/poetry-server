Hiro Murai on the ‘Atlanta’ Finale and ‘This Is America’ Video
How do you decide who will direct which episodes, between you, Donald and in this season, Amy Seimetz?

This season, we knew that we wanted to give Van’s story lines to a female director. We treated that as its own arc, so therefore someone could come in and sculpt that any way they wanted. With Donald, obviously, it’s tricky because he’s in the show a lot. It’s very difficult to direct and act at the same time. Sometimes it’s a practical decision. The reason he did the “Barbershop” episode was because he wasn’t in it. But the “FUBU” episode, with the kids, that story is about him and his brother — it’s really a very personal story. So it just made sense for him to be the guy telling it.

As a director, you like to play with depth of field, where there’s one thing happening in the foreground and a separate thing that’s more subtly in the back. That’s used in “Atlanta” and to great effect in “This Is America.”

It’s something that I’ve always been attracted to, that idea of letting everything happen in a single frame. I think the writing of the show is really similar, where none of it is very flowery. It’s very to the point and matter-of-fact. What I like about staging things in a single frame is that it has this same cadence visually.

Because you guys do tend to layer so much meaning, you get a lot of fans obsessing over identifying symbols and allusions. How much do you keep up with the internet chatter and Reddit sleuthing?

I’m a casual observer from a safe distance. I kind of love it, to be honest. Those fan theories are in line with what I like about the show. There’s more to this world than you’re seeing. So that gives me a lot of reassurance that that feeling is getting communicated.
