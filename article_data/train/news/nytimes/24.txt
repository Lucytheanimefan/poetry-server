Lawyer for 2 Women Who Say They Were Schneiderman Victims Talked to Michael Cohen
A lawyer who said he was working on behalf of two women who claimed that the former New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, had “sexually victimized” them, asserted on Friday that he had discussed the claims in 2013 with Michael D. Cohen, Donald J. Trump’s longtime lawyer and fixer.

The lawyer for the women, Peter J. Gleason, filed a letter on Friday in the ongoing investigation of Mr. Cohen, seeking an order to protect any records that Mr. Cohen may have concerning the women. As part of that investigation, federal agents raided Mr. Cohen’s office, apartment and hotel room last month.

Mr. Gleason said in an interview that Mr. Cohen had told him that if Mr. Trump were to run for and be elected governor of New York, he would help bring to light the women’s accusations about Mr. Schneiderman. There had been deep animus between Mr. Trump and Mr. Schneiderman ever since Mr. Schneiderman filed a $40 million civil fraud lawsuit against Trump University in August 2013.

Mr. Gleason’s accusations came to light in the letter, filed to Kimba M. Wood, the Manhattan federal judge overseeing the Cohen investigation.
