China Is Banned From Airing Eurovision After Censoring Performance With Gay Theme
LONDON — The grand final of the Eurovision Song Contest will not be shown in China after two performances were censored in a local broadcast.

The European Broadcasting Union (E.B.U.), which organizes Eurovision and licenses broadcasts around the world, terminated its contract with the Chinese channel Mango TV after Ireland’s performance was cut, and other sections were blurred to obscure details, when the first semifinal aired on Wednesday.

The singer Ryan O’Shaughnessy, representing Ireland, sang a sentimental breakup ballad, “Together,” which featured two male performers dancing and holding hands. This section of the competition did not feature in the broadcast in China.

The state-funded news outlet Global Times said that the Chinese broadcaster also blurred images of the rainbow flag, an L.G.B.T. symbol, waved in the audience during Switzerland’s performance. The BBC News website showed a still from the broadcast in which the flag had been obscured.
