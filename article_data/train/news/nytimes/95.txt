A Townhouse Where Nancy Reagan and Danish Royalty Partied
Much in John L. Loeb Jr.’s life has changed since he bought a five-story, 20-foot-wide townhouse with a facade of Connecticut brownstone at 237 East 61st Street in Manhattan for $200,000 in 1961.

At the time of purchase, he was a partner at Loeb, Rhoades & Co., the Wall Street firm founded by his grandfather and father in 1931. Later, he became the U.S. ambassador to Denmark, from 1981 to 1983.

He served as a delegate to the United Nations. He became a leading collector of Danish art. He founded the wine brand Sonoma-Loeb. He created the George Washington Institute for Religious Freedom. He was honored as a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II, and given a coat of arms by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. And, most recently, he penned a self-published tome about his experiences: “John L. Loeb Jr.: Reflections, Memories and Confessions.”

One of the few constants through it all, however, was the townhouse, which was originally built by Alfred and Samuel Bussell in 1875. Over the past half century, Mr. Loeb has used his home to throw parties for notable guests including Nancy Reagan; former President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa; Prince Frederick of Denmark; and Leonard A. Lauder and Judy Glickman Lauder.
