Five Places to Go in Düsseldorf
No longer a secret, “Little Tokyo on the Rhine” is increasingly drawing visitors with an appetite for all things Japanese. For decades, Japanese professionals have called this compact Düsseldorf neighborhood home. Steps from the Rhine Bank Promenade, where centuries-old pubs serve Düsseldorf’s traditional “Altbier” on tap, established Japanese supermarkets and restaurants lately have been joined by trendy ramen joints, upscale sushi spots and cute bakeries, all looking to capitalize on the rising demand for authentic Asian cuisine. The enclave, with one of the largest Japanese communities in Europe, is within walking distance of several of the city’s heralded art museums as well as the Königsallee, the lively shopping boulevard known as “Kö.” Not to be missed in the neighborhood is the annual Japan Day festivities on May 26, culminating with a grand fireworks display.

Yoshi by Nagaya

Now two years old, this sliver of a restaurant offers a more casual, wallet-friendly version of its upscale sister restaurant Nagaya a few blocks away. Each now has a Michelin star, but Yoshi seems to draw a trendier crowd with its artfully arranged raw seafood and a sleek design that affords most seats a good view of the masterful performance by its young sushi chefs.
