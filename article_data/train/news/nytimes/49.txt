Opinion | Churches Can No Longer Hide Domestic Violence
Of all the some 20,000 words the ABC published on the subject in one week in July, the attacks on us mostly centered on a quote from an American expert. We cited Steven Tracy, a professor of theology and ethics at Phoenix Seminary in Arizona, who wrote in 2007: “It is widely accepted by abuse experts (and validated by numerous studies) that one-fourth to one-third of North American women will be assaulted by an intimate partner in their life time and that evangelical men who sporadically attend church are more likely than men of any other religious group (and more likely than secular men) to assault their wives.”

Defenders of the church were enraged that we quoted this research and with our suggestion that nominal or occasional churchgoers are more prone to being abusers. One American sociology professor joined the melee by arguing we should trust only polling and data — and not individual stories like the ones we gathered firsthand from hundreds of women.

(We also reported that research suggests “regular church attenders are less likely to commit acts of intimate partner violence,” although it appears there is insufficient evidence to support this claim.)

But the point is not whether church communities are more or less prone to domestic violence. It’s that they are not immune from it. Believing they are immune leads to a dangerous ignorance.

On the sidelines, the women who had scraped together the courage to tell their stories sat stunned, silenced, dismissed.

Then more started to speak. Within days, entire support groups of clergy wives emerged, furious at having been ignored so blithely, again, by powerful men.

There are crucial lessons to be gleaned from Australia for the American #churchtoo movement, which followed #metoo and prompted an outpouring of stories of assault and harassment in church communities, including cover-ups of the molesting of young girls, and rapists now working as pastors.
