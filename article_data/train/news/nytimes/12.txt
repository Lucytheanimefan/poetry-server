Like a Tattoo, This Wedding Favor Is Forever
The occasion of a beloved niece’s wedding imbues the tattoos with more meaning, and it was, Mr. Munshin noted, “a cool party.”

Not surprisingly, both bride and groom sported tattoos. Ms. Merinoff’s designs make up what she calls a “road map of her life” that signify special moments. When she pulls up the sleeves of her sweater in an attempt to get a count, she gives up almost immediately. While planning her wedding, she said she thought, “What better moment to really keep forever?”

Ms. Merinoff and Mr. Kwasienski, who are opening a boutique distillation company in Greenport, N.Y., chose the tattoo artist Bryce Oprandi of the Los Angeles area to work at their wedding. Ms. Merinoff had become a big fan of his work after following him on Instagram.

When they met for drinks in New York, she said, she immediately asked him to be at the wedding simply for his laid-back energy. “I thought to myself, ‘I want this guy around,’” she said. The couple covered his travel and accommodations, as well as a flat rate for his time. They had planned for only a few of the 400-plus guests to get small tattoos from a limited selection featuring a coupe glass, the wedding date and others. But Mr. Oprandi ended up working on a couple dozen guests up until the end of the night.

Tattoo artists are one way to subvert and personalize longstanding traditions, much like having mixed gender bridesmaids and groomsmen.
