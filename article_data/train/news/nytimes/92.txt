When Cooking Is About Ease, Not ‘Easy’

This dish, created by Moroccan Jews who are long gone from Essaouira, inspired my fish koftas in tomato and lime sauce. It also taught me a lesson about the importance of ease in cooking. There was nothing particularly simple about the dish I was so generously served; it involved some serious cooking with very basic equipment. The flavors were complex and well rounded. But there was a serenity and confidence there that comes from cooking something for the hundredth time. There was a great deal of intimacy, too, of the kind that, I can only imagine, just happens when you spend half your life with other men on a small boat.

Paradoxically, my anxious cooking in front of a crowd involved a dish that, in theory, was much simpler to make: a whole fish in marinade, grilled and served with a plain salsa. What could go wrong? The mackerel fillets with pistachio and cardamom salsa, which is a simpler take on the flavor profile of my koftas, should be equally untaxing.

My Moroccan experience, however, showed me that stressless cooking is not always about “easy,” but about “ease”; it’s not about a dish but about a state of mind. For me, that means being able to create for myself an intimate moment in the kitchen (or on a boat, if that’s where I happen to be); it means finding a quiet space to cook and properly engage; it means preferring the real show (sitting down for a delicious meal) over the showmanship.
