On U.S.-North Korea Talks, China May Hold the Cards
Even as Mr. Trump is celebrating North Korea’s release of three American prisoners, China has many reasons to believe it will come out ahead in the coming talks.

For one thing, its leverage over sanctions enforcement means its view on the main issues — the method and pace of denuclearization — will carry weight with both North Korea and the United States. Beyond that, it sees the prospect of progress toward a longstanding security goal: the withdrawal of United States troops from the Korean Peninsula.

While he has emphasized the importance of moving quickly, President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has also endorsed an “action for action” approach to denuclearization, putting his position closer to that of China and North Korea than of the United States. The joint declaration issued after his summit meeting with Mr. Kim last month set no deadline for denuclearization, suggesting the diplomatic momentum is already shifting toward a phased approach.

This could make it easier for the North to reject demands to discard its weapons quickly, forcing Mr. Trump to choose between accepting a more gradual process or going home empty-handed despite the expectations he has built ahead of the meeting.

“The obvious risk that America faces in the summit is that Trump makes a big concession to Kim, without getting anything close to full denuclearization in return,” said Hugh White, a professor of international strategic studies at the Australian National University.

If Mr. Trump cannot get the big breakthrough he wants in denuclearization, he may try instead to negotiate a treaty to establish diplomatic relations with the North and formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted by an armistice.

Mr. Trump has shown great enthusiasm for signing an official peace treaty with North Korea, a gesture that he has said would be good for everyone.
