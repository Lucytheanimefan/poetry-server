Copy Edit This! Quiz No. 12
Here’s the latest installment of our copy editing quiz. Each of the passages below, from recent Times articles, contains at least one clear error in grammar or word usage. I’m not counting less-than-elegant phrasing that could be improved, or other more subjective editing judgments.

You don’t have to explain the error or fix it; just click on the part you think is wrong. If I agree, you’ll see my explanation. If you’re off base, try again.

And remember, we’re on deadline here!
