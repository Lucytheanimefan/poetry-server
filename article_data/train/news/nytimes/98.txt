The Photographer Nacho Alegre Captures His Creative World — in Polaroids
Ten years ago, the Barcelona-based photographer Nacho Alegre founded the cult interiors magazine Apartamento with his friend, the art director Omar Sosa, over coffee at Alegre’s house. Their goal: to create a less stuffy, more personal home publication. Since then, each issue of the irresistibly fat biannual tome — which goes beneath the surface of beautiful homes with candid photographs and leisurely interviews — has become a treasured object among the design obsessed. In addition to running the magazine, which frequently features his own images, Alegre continues to work as a roaming photographer, shooting fashion editorials and artful still lifes with seemingly off-the-cuff but immaculate style.

To celebrate Apartamento’s 10th anniversary, the magazine recently hosted a dinner with the Danish design company Hay in Milan, during Salone del Mobile, featuring food by the Danish chef Frederik Bille Brahe and a guest list of creative friends. T sent Alegre a Polaroid camera to photograph the event and his many travels — from Milan to Barcelona to the Catalan town of Púbol, where Salvador Dalí transformed a crumbling farmhouse once owned by Alegre’s family into a surrealist castle. Nearby, in the medieval village of La Tallada d’Empordà, Alegre recently renovated a home of his own.
