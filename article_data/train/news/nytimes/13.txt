Meet Me at the Commons
Family members also live on the other floors, and many are involved in the Commons in one way or another: Brett’s wife, Tamara McCarthy, is responsible for the graphic design, and their cousin, Jessica Corr, helped design the space. Sam and Brett’s father, Richard, doesn’t live in the building but is a lawyer for the business, and their mother, Arlene Novick, is responsible for many of the baked goods, delivering pumpkin bread, lemon glazed cake and chocolate chip cookies throughout the week. Family members don’t roast the coffee beans, however. They come from the Philadelphia-based brand, La Colombe.

Sam used to work in real estate. One day, when he noticed that the shoe store he lived above was for rent, he sensed an opportunity: “We always felt that the big void in our neighborhood back then was the lack of a specialty coffee cafe, so we thought, why not create one ourselves?”

Sam is a constant presence at the shop while Brett pops in and out. When the warm weather comes, the three outdoor tables are a popular spot for lingering. On this day, Billy Allen took in the sun while sipping a cappuccino. The Harlem resident was waiting for his girlfriend, Susan, who works nearby. He said that the Commons is his favorite hangout when he is in the area. “Susan is here every day, and I come when I have the chance,” he said. “I love the intimate size and great staff and coffee.”
