New Yorkers Who Love Where They Live
It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Antonina Munz FitzGerald likes her apartment building, but what a pale declaration. You might just as well say that Kim Kardashian likes her Instagram account.

In fact, Ms. FitzGerald loves, loves, loves her building, Plaza 400, a 40-story postwar co-op in the Sutton Place area. Let her count the ways.

It’s self-managed, which keeps the maintenance more than manageable, with utilities included. Shareholders also get a good deal on cable. There’s abundant security, a pool on the roof, a freshly upgraded lobby and handymen who, stunningly enough, according to Ms. FitzGerald, are every bit as handy as her late husband.

The building also sports a new logo, “which has a nice modern look,” continued Ms. FitzGerald, 76, who until her retirement was an executive assistant to a judge in the appellate division of New York State Court. It must be said that when it comes to her Plaza 400, she takes note, favorable note, of everything. This includes the doormen, who are clad in dark gray, a recent change from black, “They look very well dressed,” she said. “Who can resist a man in a uniform?”
