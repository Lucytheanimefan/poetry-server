Big Donors Form New Alliance to Seize House From Republicans
“The idea is to win 24 highly curated races,” said Alan Patricof, a venture capitalist and Democratic donor, who said that many of the contributors involved have worked together for decades.

Mr. Patricof said the goal was finding candidates with a “high probability of prevailing” in November.

Paperwork to form the House Victory Project was filed last month with the Federal Election Commission and it listed 10 initial Democratic House candidates: Tom Malinowski and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey; Jason Crow of Colorado; Susie Lee of Nevada; Brad Ashford of Nebraska; Angie Craig of Minnesota; Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida; Elissa Slotkin of Michigan; Elaine Luria of Virginia; and Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona.

One donor, who was approached about joining but declined and requested anonymity to speak candidly about the effort, said the group was raising the political profiles in Washington of its leaders by bundling donations from others.

“This is taking the Wall Street theory of ‘other people’s money’ and applying it to politics,” the donor said. “They want to be the ones to deliver the check, to be the players.”

Campaign bundlers — those who collect contributions from friends and associates — have risen to national prominence, such as Paul E. Singer, the Republican hedge fund manager who can raise six-figure sums for House candidates, and donates millions of dollars to national G.O.P. causes and candidates.

For House candidates, large-scale direct campaign contributions are a hard commodity to come by.

Federal election rules limit direct donations to candidates to $2,700 per donor for both the primary and general election, but joint committees, such as the House Victory Project, can bundle those contributions into one larger check.
