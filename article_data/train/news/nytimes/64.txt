Review: In ‘Revenge,’ the Trophy Turns Hunter
Blunt, bloody and stylish almost in spite of itself, “Revenge” is a synthesis of exploitation and feminism, which might strike you as antithetical ideas. The basic plot — a woman collecting payback from the men who have assaulted her — is not exactly new, and it’s a conceit that can be used as an alibi. The way a movie like this often goes is that the audience is invited to revel in the spectacle of sexual violence and also in the violent punishment that follows. Misogyny is indulged so it can be condemned, and vice versa.

Coralie Fargeat, making an impressive, uncompromising feature-directing debut, sets out to avoid that trap, or at least to build a better one. “Revenge” begins at a high pitch of travel porn and commodity fetishism. A helicopter alights near a luxurious modernist villa in the desert (possibly in Mexico, though the end credits say Morocco), disgorging a guy (Kevin Janssens) with accessories that identify him as one of life’s winners: a chunky watch, a gym-carved physique and a young girlfriend (Matilda Lutz) who suggestively tongues a lollipop as she peeps through candy-colored sunglasses.
