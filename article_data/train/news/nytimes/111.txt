Preserving Their Identity as Fukushima Samurai
When the Fukushima samurai gathered in 2011 for their annual three-day festival of Soma-Nomaoi, they were dressed in traditional military robes astride horses clad in armor. As their ancestors had done for centuries, they conducted military exercises amid the pageantry.

But that year was different.

A few months earlier, a deadly earthquake and tsunami had hit eastern Japan, sending 32-foot waves over the Fukushima Daiichi power plant and triggering the world’s largest nuclear meltdown since Chernobyl. Despite death and displacement, and the loss of their horses and their armory, the samurai decided they had to come together.

“I thought, this is not just an event, but the embodiment of their identity and a fight for survival,” said Noriko Takasugi. “This sense of identity represents how and why they live.”
