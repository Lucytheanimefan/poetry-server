Opinion | Germany’s Secret Labor Experiment
To hear it from politicians and political commentators, Germany is helpless in the face of a mounting refugee crisis — after accepting more than a million over the past few years, the country is bursting at the seams.

But that’s just a convenient — if dangerous — narrative for our immigration-wary times. In fact, Germany is moving at full speed with a plan to channel those refugees into its work force. Germany’s political class is doing the country an egregious disfavor by soft-pedaling its muscular, state-of-the-art efforts in labor market integration.

Germany does indeed face a demographic crisis, but it’s not from the influx of refugees. Its population is aging rapidly, and jobs are going unfilled. Over the next decade, Germany is going to need even more — not fewer — immigrants to keep its economy on track and cover growing pension outlays. Even this year, a leading think tank warns, labor bottlenecks will cost Germany nearly 1 percent in lost gross domestic product. A shortfall of three million skilled workers is predicted by 2030.

Unfortunately, today many German politicians tend to speak about immigration as a security threat, a job stealer, a cultural blight and a welfare burden, even when migrants could help fill an estimated 1.6 million job vacancies. Outside of the public spotlight, though, Germany’s approach is one of hard-nosed economic pragmatism, distinguished by innovative social policy and the bending of rules to fast-track refugees into schools and vocational training and, eventually, jobs. At its heart is the country’s storied apprenticeship program, which is ramping up efforts to transform Iraqi, Syrian, Afghan and other refugees into qualified, productive, taxpaying workers.
