When Tim Tebow Comes to Town
With no previous ties to the region, he led a group (Evans Street Baseball Inc.) that purchased the Binghamton Mets (as they were then known) in 2015, after the team’s deal with a different ownership group that would have moved it to Delaware fell through.

“His commitment to this community is huge,” said Judi Hess, director of the city’s tourism office. “So to have something like this happen under his watch is awesome, too, because it’s like a little bit of payback for his personal investment and his belief in our community.”

Other towns have experienced the Tebow effect. When Tebow was a backup quarterback for the Jets in 2012, crowds of fans flocked to training camp in Cortland, N.Y., about 40 miles north of Binghamton. The visitors’ bureau projected that about $1 million of additional revenue would be injected into the town’s economy.

In Tebow’s first stint in minor league baseball, with the Class A Columbia Fireflies in South Carolina, attendance grew by about 750 fans per home game — or $600,000 in revenue for the club, Baseball America estimated. His next stop was Port St. Lucie, Fla., where the Class A Mets soon experienced record attendance.

“It was nice being able to play in front of people,” said Peter Alonso, a top Mets prospect here who also played with Tebow in Port St. Lucie.
