Motherless, but Growing Toward the Light
The desire is no less strong now as an adult woman, longing for the voice at the end of a late night phone call or an authority on how to thicken soup or remove a stain. People are not handing out mothers on the street. I have not yet managed to achieve, please or bargain my way into having one. And I still sometimes express this lack by being needy, annoying and attention seeking. My poor, long-suffering husband.

Though I have cobbled together some answers from experience, Google and good friends, my mother wound remains. I cry at movies about mothers. I cry at the trailers of movies about mothers. I cry if someone I know has a fight with her mother. I cry if I even think about becoming a mother. How would I know how without having had a model? Meanwhile, my own fecund uterine years are slipping by.

Then comes along my mother-in-law.

When I first met my partnerâ€™s parents 12 years ago, I spent three hours deciding on the most capable and love-deserving outfit in my closet, settling on a baby-pink sweater under a black blazer. We decided to meet in Manhattan for Italian food since they would be taking the train in from Connecticut.

I had so many questions for them. Did my husband always love to read? When did you know he had a gift for music? What was he like as a little boy?

I wanted to understand the years I had missed in his life, the years that shaped him into the wonderful human being he had become.
