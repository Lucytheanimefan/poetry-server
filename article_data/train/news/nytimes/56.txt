“They thought they could do anything,” Billoud told me. “You have to remain correct. They went over the top with all those tables. You have a right to a certain number of places, but no more.”

Christian Deville, a waiter at La Brazza who has only worked there for two decades, chimed in: “Here in France, the freedom of each person stops at the point where it impinges on the freedom of others. They passed that point. We showed tolerance; no longer.”

I confess I found the feud reassuring. Everything changes. Something in France does not. Here in the sea of chic boutiques and brands that is St. Germain-des-Prés today, in the midst of metropolitan transience, were two rooted families with long-serving employees, in the same businesses for decades, fighting over their rights to a patch of earth, sunlit or not, their urban “terroir.”

In France, the mix of soil, hearth and tradition that constitute “terroir” is personal. You poke around in it. You discover that some ineffable quality of the land, its particular characteristics, and the human bond to it has found expression in a unique wine, or cheese or paté — of the kind Au Sauvignon specializes in.

Of course, the sidewalks of Paris are not the French countryside. But the owners of Au Sauvignon and La Brazza are fighting over boundaries, like farmers squabbling over the line of a fence.

In reality, their battle has scant logic. The two cafes keep different hours. Their menus and wine lists have little in common. One sells cigarettes, one not. They’ve coexisted for many decades while all around them has changed. As Deville told me: “It’s gotten a lot more bourgeois around here. It used to be more convivial. People say hello but they don’t look you in the eye.”

That’s a scourge of the contemporary world: transactional interactions, stripped of human content, between solipsistic people addicted to their devices.
