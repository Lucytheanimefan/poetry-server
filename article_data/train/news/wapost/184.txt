This Ramadan, I’m focusing on fostering tender masculinity in my son
There were whole decades growing up during which I was confused or enraged by both white and South Asian Americans who told me that I had to choose between my American and Pakistani identities. It took me years to realize that I didn’t need anyone’s permission to imagine and fully embody my whole self; to claim both countries and swallow them whole. I was determined to give my son a joyful sense of himself – in which his multiple heritages are an adornment, not a confinement – and to be available to answer all his questions with the openness that I had longed for as a child.
