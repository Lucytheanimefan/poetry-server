Former CIA contractor pleads guilty to mishandling classified documents
A former CIA contractor who copied classified information into personal notebooks then lied about it to the FBI, pleaded guilty Friday to unauthorized removal of classified materials and related charges, prosecutors said.

Reynaldo B. Regis, 53, of Fort Washington, Md., conducted unauthorized searches in classified databases and copied classified information into personal notebooks while an employee of a government contractor assigned to the CIA between 2006 and 2016, the Justice Department said in a statement.

He also removed the notebooks from his office at the CIA and stored them at home without authorization, the statement said, and lied about his actions when interviewed by federal officials. During a search of Regis’s home, the FBI found about 60 notebooks with classified information about sensitive intelligence reports, according to the statement.

On Friday, Regis pleaded guilty to unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials and making false statements to federal law enforcement officers, prosecutors said. He is to be sentenced in September and faces up to five years in prison.

“He’s a decent man who has provided service to the country for a long time,” John Zwerling, Regis’s attorney, said in a statement. “He made a mistake and acknowledged it, accepted responsibility for it and now stands as a felon.”
