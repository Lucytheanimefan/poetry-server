The killing comes as the D.C. region has seen 92 homicides so far this year, according to a tracking done by The Washington Post. In the District, there’s been an increase of more than 40 percent in homicides compared with this point in 2017, when 39 people had been killed.

This year’s victims have included five youths between the ages of 14 and 17. On Wednesday, 17-year-old Damoni Gaither was fatally shot near his home in the 300 block of Anacostia Road SE.

On Friday, D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham acknowledged the recent uptick in homicides, calling it a “tough couple of weeks in the city” at a news conference on a police-involved shooting.

He said police investigators are finding that the incidents “oftentimes involve individual disputes between known parties.”
