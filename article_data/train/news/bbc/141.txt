Matilda and the Ramsay Bunch - Glorious Gold Medal Doughnuts
METHOD



Preheat the oven to 180C.

Place the butter, sugar and vanilla into a large bowl and whisk with an electric hand whisk, gradually adding the egg and mixing well.

Sift the flour and add it to the mixture then pour the mixture into the doughnut tins.

Place in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until they're golden brown and springy in the middle.

TO DECORATE

Wait for the doughnuts to cool a little and then dip in the sugar syrup/water.

Top with the gold leaf and serve.
