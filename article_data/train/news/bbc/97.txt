Musicians you never knew were related... and a few you did
Born in Ohio on June 10th, 1961, the Deal sisters may not have spent their subsequent 56 years trading snarling Gallagher-esque put downs but they have had their moments. From a childhood of hard rock (AC/DC, Led Zep' etc) to five albums of their own, they've retained a strong bond. Both have had their battles with drugs and The Breeders have featured multiple line-up changes down the years, as the result of various issues. The most notable falling out was between Kim and drummer Jim Macpherson, they've patched things up now though. Despite their seemingly rock star shenanigans, if they were an item of clothing it'd be a grungy, moth eaten jumper, rather than a swaggering leather jacket. Kim and Kelley do have potential for sibling friction: when speaking about the recording of their new album All Nerve, Kelley admitted "I could get mad at Kim, I could always get mad at Kim...".

Despite this friction we're expecting a harmonious return to the UK for them on the May 25th, as they hit Belfast for The Biggest Weekend.
