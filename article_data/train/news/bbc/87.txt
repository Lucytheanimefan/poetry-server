Could being one of the crowd for just a few days help them change the way the live their lives forever? In this new series, three young people living with three different conditions are about to find out.

Keen artist Terrina developed Tourette’s in her final year at uni and has never met anyone with her condition. Without her boyfriend or family at her side she is anxious to leave the house, making her feel like a prisoner in her own home.

She is joined by a group of strangers who all have Tourette’s, but unlike Terrina, are more accepting of their condition and getting on with their lives. Feeling like she can just be herself for the first time since developing the condition, Terrina begins the challenging journey of accepting Tourette’s and getting her life back.
