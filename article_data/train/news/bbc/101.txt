Why I let my loved ones call me fat
In the media, fat is often portrayed as something to be feared. Fat people are shown as waiting to be unleashed into a thin body, ready to be healed by personal trainers, stylists, and celebrity doctors. We are always the 'before' shot. While in movies and on TV, fat characters are always the funny sidekick or the broken one you feel sorry for â€“ never the romantic hero everyone fancies. All of that noise creates a culture in which fat people are seen as a threat, and it translates into our daily lives.
