Three multinational companies and one firm with links to Russia that allegedly paid money into a fund used by Donald Trump's personal lawyer to pay off porn actress Stormy Daniels have said the fees were for legitimate business purposes, the Financial Times reports .

US telecoms giant AT&T, drugs firm Novartis, Korea Aerospace, and Columbus Nova paid more than $1m in total to Essential Consultants, which was set up by lawyer Michael Cohen, Ms Daniels lawyers allege.

Essential Consultants paid Ms Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, $130,000 ahead of the US election in return for her silence about an alleged affair with Mr Trump in 2006.

Mr Trump's attorney Rudi Giuliani has said Mr Trump, who denies the affair, reimbursed Mr Cohen for the pay-off.

Columbus Nova is an investment vehicle for the Renova Group, run by Viktor Vekselberg, both of which are subject to US sanctions.

Columbus Nova allegedly paid Essential Consultants $500,000, according to Ms Daniels' lawyers, the FT said.

A lawyer for Columbus Nova said "reports Mr Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen were false," the FT reported.

AT&T, which has been catching flak from Mr Trump over its proposed merger with Time Warner, said it had paid Essential Consultants "to provide insights" into the Trump administration.

Novartis said it wanted advice on US healthcare policy, and Korea Aerospace, which is vying for a US jet contract, said it wanted advice on US accounting standards.
