Barclays chief executive Jes Staley failed to set a good example to the rest of the bank says Treasury committee chair Nickey Morgan.

"A chief executive should set an example to the firm’s employees. Clearly Mr Staley has failed in this regard," she says.

“In our next evidence session with the FCA, we’ll ask why it believes that the fines are appropriate."

The committee will also ask the regulator "what it believes the implications are for the Senior Managers Regime" - the rules governing bosses' personal accountability.
