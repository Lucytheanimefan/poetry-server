A combat machine built to jump over enemy lines
The Batmobile might seem like a far-fetched concept, but its origins can be found in some real pieces of military tech.

'The Tumbler', made famous in the Dark Knight series, had the ability to jump from roof to roof as Batman chased down Gotham City's villains.

Whilst totally impractical for anyone concerned about damaging property, the idea of a jumping car has in fact been seriously considered by military research groups in the past. In fact, the idea can be traced back all the way back to World War Two.

Mega Builds is a video series from BBC Future looking at giants of engineering from around the globe.
