I tried to get a date using augmented reality
Today, nearly half of us know someone who uses a dating app, but most apps restrict us to virtual exchanges. AR, however, pushes us towards real-time, real-life interactions, while eliminating the embarrassing bit of real-life meetings: making an approach without knowing whether the other person likes you. This app matches you virtually first - then you decide whether to say hello. Itâ€™s only a few months old, but its international user base already stands at around 5,000 worldwide, 10% of whom are in London, according to the app itself.
