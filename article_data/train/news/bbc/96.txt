Brooklyn Nine-Nine and other TV shows cancelled too soon
This Western drama, starring Ian McShane and Timothy Olyphant, ran between 2004 and 2006, and attracted much praise and attention for its production values, cast, and its astonishing profanity. Though critics and a devoted fanbase sang its praises, HBO cancelled the show at the end of its third season. A reunion movie has long been on the cards - but logistics might make it impossible. “It’s very hard to get people together for a barbecue that lasts an afternoon, let alone to get everyone together for a production that lasts a month or two,” star Olyphant said in March.
