The ballet company challenging the law
Ballet Philippines was South East Asia’s first professional ballet company when it was founded. In this video, its artistic director Paul Alexander Morales talks to Jason Lai about the range of pieces danced by the company – and how it’s constantly updating to match the times.

“Our repertoire reflects the diversity of our culture, and the diversity of the future… the new Filipino,” says Morales, defining one work as “the Filipino spirit that’s trying to dance in between its different cultures, which is Spanish and Chinese”.

One of their productions is about a woman who can’t leave a bad relationship. “There’s still no divorce in the Philippines,” says Morales. “Works like this can maybe help change that.”

Jason Lai is a musician and conductor in Singapore. His interest in Asia’s arts and cultural scene goes beyond music to the very core of what it reveals about the heart and soul of these countries.

Episode 2 of Heart of the Philippines screens on Friday 11 May 0655GMT and again at 0755GMT, 1155GMT, 1250GMT, 1350GMT, 1455GMT and 1655GMT on BBC World News.
