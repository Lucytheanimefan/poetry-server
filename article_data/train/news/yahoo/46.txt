The 15 Best-Designed Hotels Opening This Summer
Designed by Hirsch Bedner Associations, this new property, whose local moniker means “secret water island,” is a 120-villa resort on the Shaviyani Atoll in North Maldives. The atoll boasts a large lagoon, plenty of marine life, and an underwater art installation by Jason deCaires Taylor that is also the Maldives’ first coral regeneration project. The resort’s design was inspired by objects found on the island itself (for instance, a clump of fishing nets washed up on the beach). The airy restaurant has accents of rope and vintage glass balls from fishermen’s nets; an open-air bamboo bar was crafted by Balinese artisans who used no man-made materials. sirrufenfushi.com
