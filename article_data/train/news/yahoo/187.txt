WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Latest on President Donald Trump's rally in Indiana with Vice President Mike Pence (all times local):

8:35 p.m.

President Donald Trump is taking on Indiana's Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly, branding him "Sleepin' Joe" and a "swamp person" at a rally in Elkhart, Indiana.

Trump assailed Donnelly on Thursday, two days after Republicans nominated former state lawmaker Mike Braun to challenge the vulnerable Democratic in November. It's expected to be one of the most competitive Senate campaigns.

Trump says Donnelly will "do whatever Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi tell him to do" and "say one thing in Elkhart," and then support the "radical, liberal agenda."

Before the rally, Donnelly's campaign said the senator had voted with Trump 62 percent of the time "because he works for Hoosiers, not any politician or political party."

Trump's political advisers see the rally as a way to project party unity following a bruising primary.
