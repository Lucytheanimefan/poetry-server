Gaza's bloody uprising
The Palestinian enclave of Gaza has been wracked by increasingly violent protests by bands of youths attempting to storm the Israeli border with firebombs, burning tires and wire-cutters. They have been repulsed by troops firing rubber bullets and live ammunition, and at least 40 have been killed. Italian photojournalist Fabio Bucciarelli has been documenting the protests, and the casualties, for weeks, and filed these riveting, and disturbing, images.
