Donald Trump Jr. reportedly dating Fox News' Kimberly Guilfoyle 2 months after split
It's no secret that some Fox News personalities have an affinity for the Trump administration -- in fact, some seem to find the White House staffers downright irresistable.

Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle is reportedly dating Donald Trump Jr., who recently split from Vanessa Trump, his wife of 12 years. If that story sounds a bit familiar, it's because in late 2017, Guilfoyle was romantically linked to Anthony Scaramucci just weeks after he and his wife separated.

â€œDon Jr. and Kimberly are seeing each other and are having a great time," a source told Page Six of the budding relationship.

Guilfoyle, a co-host Fox News' "The Five," was spotted with Trump Jr. on Sunday at a Manhattan party honoring President Trump's new ambassador to Germany. After the party, they left together to grab a late dinner at ritzy restaurant Harry Cipriani.

Notably, Guilfoyle was seen with Scaramucci as recently as March 2018, when he reportedly called newsrooms in a rage after reports emerged that the two were seen out together. He is supposedly trying to repair his marriage.

Guilfoyle has a son from a previous marriage, while Trump Jr. has five children from his marriage to Vanessa. His relationship publicly crumbled as news broke that he'd had a lengthy affair with former "The Apprentice" contestant Aubrey O'Day.
