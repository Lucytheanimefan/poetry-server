Weeks after cancer surgery, Jim Kelly takes in Bills' rookie camp
The Buffalo Bills’ draft class and undrafted players are gathered this weekend for rookie mini-camp, and on Friday they got a surprise: the franchise’s greatest quarterback made an appearance.

It’s definitely news that Jim Kelly was on hand: just six weeks ago, on March 28, Kelly underwent 12 hours of surgery to remove oral cancer and rebuild his upper jaw. It’s the third time in the last five years Kelly finds himself battling cancer.

The Hall of Famer of course wanted to watch Buffalo’s first-round pick, quarterback Josh Allen, and the young offensive players.

“I’m shaking right now,” Allen said after meeting Kelly post-practice. “One of the greatest quarterbacks to play the game and one of the greatest quarterbacks in Buffalo history.”

They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries in front of cameras, but then the two went into the quiet of the Bills’ locker room for a chat.

Kelly was walking with a cane and looked frail, which is to be expected after what he’s endured in recent weeks.
