At least five Illinois counties are planning on "flipping the script" on the far-left's "sanctuary city" designation, Dana Perino reported on "The Five."

Perino said the counties decided to declare themselves "sanctuaries" for gun owners who would otherwise be affected by restrictive laws passed in Springfield.

Effingham County State's Attorney Bryan Kibler said in a recent interview that he wants to make his constituency a "sanctuary county how they would for undocumented immigrants."

"What's good for the goose is good for the gun owner," Greg Gutfeld remarked. "If you decide to exempt a group of people from laws, then why can't everybody do it? Why are you special?"

Kimberly Guilfoyle warned that the sentiment could cause problems in the future.

"[Counties] can't legislate based on popular emotions or sentiments at the time," she said. "That's not how a lawful society works."

Juan Williams said the idea "doesn't have much meaning" and added that the "sanctuary" movement came about as Catholic churches had been allowing illegal immigrants to seek refuge from deportation inside their doors.

He said the church would likely not do the same for gun owners in that regard.
