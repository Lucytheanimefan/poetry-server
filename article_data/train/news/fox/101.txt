As for what the doughnut is like? Dunkin’ says it's “filled with jelly and frosted with chocolate icing and a strawberry drizzle.”

The company says customers will be able to get their hands on the sweet concoction at participating stores from May 14 to May 20.

Despite the news, Dunkin’ Donuts is no stranger to making doughnuts with the royal family in mind. The company also made a “Royal Wedding Donut” for Prince William and Kate Middleton in April 2011.

At the time, Dunkin’ described the treat as a “a heart-shaped donut filled with jelly and topped with vanilla icing and a chocolate drizzle.'”
