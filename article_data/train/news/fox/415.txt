"Life, Liberty & Levin" host Mark Levin laid out why he believes the Democrats and the media are supportive of Robert Mueller's probe into President Trump and alleged Russian collusion.

Levin said that no matter whether Democrats take back Congress and vote to impeach Trump on whatever grounds, they will not have the votes to remove him from office.

President Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 and President Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998. However both men were later acquitted of their charges by the Senate.

Levin did not speculate as to the probability of Trump being impeached, but said lawmakers would not make him the first president to be removed from office.

"They'll never get two-thirds of the Senate [which is required] to remove this president," Levin said.

He said Democrats hope to "trap" Trump in Mueller's "notion of a subpoenaed questioning."

Levin said they hope by humiliating him in a prospective court appearance or by possibly persuading the Supreme Court to side with them, "then get him to resign."

"That's their gameplan," he said. "Mr. Mueller is undermining the Constitution. He's not upholding the rule of law."
