The “Thelma & Louise” actress and Jarrahy, a doctor, were married on Sept. 1, 2001, and have three children together. They met through friends in 1999 and were engaged a year later.

Jarrahy is requesting “spousal support and joint legal and physical custody of their children,” according to court documents. He reportedly asked a judge to refuse Davis any spousal support requests.
