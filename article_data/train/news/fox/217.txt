(VIDEO) Want To See McCabe Behind Bars? Charles Hurt Say Donâ€™t Hold Your Breath
The Justice Department's inspector general says fired FBI head Andrew McCabe should be prosecuted!

But if you think this means McCabe or anyone related to the FBI's apparently botched investigation of the Clinton scandals will go to jail ... don't hold your breath.

At least according to the Washington Times opinion editor Charles Hurt.

On Thursday's show, Fox News Contributor Charles Hurt and Tom Shillue discussed why even after the latest developments about the Clinton scandals, both agreed they highly doubt anyone at the DOJ will pursue charges against McCabe, his former boss James Comey or Hillary CLinton.
