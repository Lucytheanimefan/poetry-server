Jurors in Mafia boss trial visit killing, burial sites
Jurors who will decide whether former New England Mafia boss Francis "Cadillac Frank" Salemme is guilty of having a federal witness killed have viewed the home where prosecutors say the killing took place.

Jurors traveled to Sharon, Massachusetts on Friday to see the home where prosecutors say Steven DiSarro was strangled in 1993. Jurors also went to Providence, Rhode Island, where DiSarro's remains were found behind a mill building in 2016.

Prosecutors say Salemme watched as his son strangled DiSarro, and another man, Paul Weadick, held DiSarro's feet. Prosecutors say they killed DiSarro to keep him from cooperating with authorities.

Weadick is also on trial. Salemme's son died in 1995. Salemme and DiSarro deny any involvement in the killing.

Testimony in the case will resume Monday.
