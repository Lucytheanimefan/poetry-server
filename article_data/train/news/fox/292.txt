Retired Delta Force General: Trump Ditching Iran Deal a 'Sterling Example of Int'l Leadership'

National Security Adviser John Bolton said in an "Ingraham Angle" exclusive that the Iran nuclear deal has been "flawed from the beginning."

He said that President Donald Trump laid out his objective to rescind America's participation in the agreement as far back as the 2016 election season.

Bolton said the deal's flaws "go right to [its] foundation."

"It's in our security interest to get out of this flawed deal," he said, adding that now, there is a better ability "stop this dangerous [Iranian] regime."

He said the deal "facilitated Iran's efforts" to further its nuclear weapons program.

Bolton ripped former Secretary of State John Kerry for speaking with the Iranians about the deal.

"Kerry's objective was to get a deal," he said, adding that in recent days, Kerry's objective was to "keep the deal."
