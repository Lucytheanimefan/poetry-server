Judge Jeanine Pirro said it's time for Republicans to stop fighting with each other and start supporting President Trump.

"Who do we blame for the repeated trashing of the first lady? Why is it open season on the first family? Who do we blame for the refusal to honor congressional subpoenas? There is only one group to blame, and that group is the Republican Party," Pirro said in her opening statement on "Justice" Saturday night.

She said the GOP holds the House, Senate and White House, but establishment Republicans are enabling Democrats and those on the left to wield power, obstruct the president's agenda and attack the first family.

She also called out Republican lawmakers for allowing Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice and the FBI to stonewall them on the FISA abuse scandal and the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

"It's time for the Republicans to start wielding power," Pirro said. "They've got to learn to stop their namby-pamby, spineless finger-to-the-wind approach to running the country. It's time for Republicans to stop fighting with each other and start supporting the president."

"This is not going to end well unless and until Republicans get the guts to wield the power to run our government the way it is supposed to be run."
