Former U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is a "classic careerist."

DiGenova ripped Rosenstein's actions in regard to the Mueller probe into President Donald Trump and alleged collusion with Russia.

He said he would support charges of contempt against Rosenstein if they are brought.

"What is true now is that all of the redactions [in documents provided to Congress] thus far that we have seen... are things that are embarrassing to the FBI and DOJ under Barack Obama," he said.

"This has to stop right now," diGenova said of the apparently political redactions.

He called Rosenstein -- formerly a U.S. attorney from Maryland -- a "classic careerist" who believes "no one in the DOJ can do something wrong."

DiGenova remarked that if Mueller finds that Trump obstructed justice by firing then-FBI Director James Comey, Rod Rosenstein is a legitimate co-conspirator because he signed the memorandum suggesting Comey be terminated.

DiGenova and Sean Hannity also voiced their displeasure in the actions of Rosenstein's boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
