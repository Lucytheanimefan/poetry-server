Laura Ingraham said Thursday that both President Obama's pick to lead the CIA and President Trump's nominee either supported or worked under the policy of enhanced interrogation techniques.

Ingraham said that in 2013 at Obama nominee John Brennan's confirmation hearing, 13 Republicans broke with their party to support his nomination, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona.

She said Brennan either supported or was involved in operations involving the techniques which some consider torture.

He was asked whether and subsequently confirmed that interrogation techniques used on detainees "provided information that was useful [in]... the ultimate operation to go after Bin Laden."

At the same time, Ingraham said Democrats, except for Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are signaling their opposition to Gina Haspel, Trump's nominee.

"Where were their objections [against Brennan]?" she said, reporting that Haspel was a subordinate to Brennan in the early 2000s.

She played video of Haspel critic Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) praising Brennan's nomination.

"What happened to that first DiFi?" Ingraham asked. "What's changed?"

Ingraham said the key change is that Donald Trump is president and that Democrats seek to undermine his nominees to hamper his agenda.
