President Trump held a rally in support of Indiana Republican U.S. Senate nominee Mike Braun and blasted incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) for voting against the president's agenda.

"Joe Donnelly voted against enhanced vetting [of illegal immigrants]," Trump said.

"What in the world would anybody be doing voting against enhanced vetting?" he asked.

Trump said Donnelly votes in lockstep with party leaders Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).

Trump said Donnelly opposed a measure that would have blocked illegal immigrants from being eligible for welfare.

He noted Donnelly's support for ObamaCare and no-vote on tax cuts.

Trump urged the crowd to vote for Braun, a businessman from Jasper, saying that he will support the Trump agenda.

Trump also made a tacit swipe at New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) for signing a bill allowing illegal immigrants to apply for collegiate financial aid.
