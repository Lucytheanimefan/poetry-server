Trump Announces Exit From Iran Deal: 'America Will Not Be Held Hostage to Nuclear Blackmail'
'Fully Fixed or Fully Nixed': Netanyahu Says He Trusts Trump to 'Do the Right Thing' on Iran Deal

President Trump on Tuesday announced his decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal.

The president addressed what he called Iran's "bloody ambitions," referencing Israel's intelligence that found Iran was "brazenly lying" about its nuclear weapons development.

"America will not be held to nuclear blackmail," the president said. "We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction."

Trump noted that although the agreement lifted economic sanctions on Iran, it in return set very "weak" limits to the regime's nuclear activity.

He said that the agreement "embarrassed" him "as a citizen," as it unfroze more than $100 billion in Iranian assets.

He also noted his recent discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying that the countries are "unified" in understanding the threat Iran is.

"After these consultations, it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the agreement," Trump said.

He called the nuclear deal "defective at its core" and said it does nothing to constrain the regime's nuclear activities.
