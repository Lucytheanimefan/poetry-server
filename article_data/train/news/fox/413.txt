In his Video of the Day segment, Sean Hannity played a clip from Thursday's episode of "The View" wherein frequent Trump critic Joy Behar took the unusual step of giving the president credit for a political decision.

After Trump's negotiations with North Korea yielded the release of three Americans held hostage in the Hermit Kingdom, Behar reacted on her program.

"Good for him," she said. "If it works, we're happy for him."

"I wish he would do what he has to do with the world... I just wish he would stop attacking the press and our American institutions," she added.

Hannity called it a "joyful day in the life of Joy Behar."

For his part, Hannity called Trump's success a "huge win for the country and the president."
