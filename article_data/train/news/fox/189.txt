Blake Shelton on karma tweet: 'People are way off the mark'
Blake Shelton says that people have been misinterpreting his intentionally vague remarks made in his recent tweet about "karma."

"If it was meant for people to know exactly what it meant, it wouldn't have been so cryptic," Shelton told ET's Sophie Schillaci during a Facebook Live interview alongside Kelly Clarkson before Monday's "The Voice." "But I can tell you it's been, actually, very entertaining to watch the world run with it and assume what they think it's about."

Shelton said he doesn't necessarily "love" the reactions his post has been getting but thinks the speculation and feverish analysis has been "funny" -- and also mostly incorrect.

"I'll say this, people are way off the mark," Shelton said. "But I don't have time to worry about it."
