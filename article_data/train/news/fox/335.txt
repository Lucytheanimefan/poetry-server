Rita Moreno says Marlon Brando was better in bed than Elvis Presley
Elvis Presley may have been The King onstage, but compared to Marlon Brando, the rock legend was a peasant between the sheets, says Rita Moreno.

“[Brando] slayed me good ’cause he was the king of everything. Eeeeeeverything,” Moreno, 86, told Wendy Williams on Thursday. “He was the king of movies … he was really one of the most sexual men on Earth. It was one of those very tempestuous love affairs. It lasted eight years, on and off, on and off, on and off.”

The “West Side Story” star admitted that she’d wanted to marry Brando, but that he wouldn’t have it — but she kept going to bed with him regardless and was heartbroken when she realized he was still sleeping with other people.

“One time when I found some lingerie that was not mine, I just went home devastated, weeping and crying — and something wonderful happened the next day,” she said.

That wonderful thing was being spotted by Presley, who “liked what he saw” and requested a meeting with Moreno. The EGOT winner said she accepted the invitation, with that stranger’s lingerie “still on [her] mind,” and her fling with the singer drove Brando mad.

“That man threw chairs,” Moreno revealed smugly. “It was wonderful!”

What wasn’t wonderful? Moreno’s sex life with Presley in comparison to her ardor with Brando. She admitted, “That’s like a 2-year-old and the king.”

Moreno previously said that her husband of 45 years, Leonard Gordon, was the love of her life, but that Brando was the lust of her life.
