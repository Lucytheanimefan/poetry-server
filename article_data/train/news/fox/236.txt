The Braxtons stopped by to spend "A Few Moments With" FOX News' Crystal Berger to discuss the 6th Season of their reality series Braxton Family Values on WE tv. The show chronicles the lives of Braxton sisters--Toni, Tamar, Traci, Towanda, and Trina--plus their mother, Evelyn. The women shared with Crystal what life was like growing up with so many women in one house, how they stay rooted in family values in such a challenging industry and all the rumors from divorce, to infidelity, to abuse.
