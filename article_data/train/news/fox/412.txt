Fox News Channel's hit docu-series "Legends & Lies" is back - Sundays at 8:00pm ET - with a riveting look at the historically significant events and people that shaped the Civil War.

In last week's episode, we relived the journey of Ulysses S. Grant, who once was drummed out of the Army for drinking and went on to earn his place as the North’s best general.

You know about President Abraham Lincoln, but how much do you know about his southern counterpart, Jefferson Davis?

This week's episode focuses on the embattled president of the Confederate States of America.

In Episode 8 of the 12-part miniseries, Davis -- a U.S. Senator, war hero and presidential aspirant -- answers the call to lead the Confederacy and faces mounting pressures as Northern troops close in on victory.

Hosted by Brian Kilmeade, "Legends & Lies" vividly recounts America’s epic struggle over slavery and freedom through the stories of the war’s greatest heroes and villains.

Check out a clip from last week's episode below, and don't miss a brand-new episode this Sunday at 8:00pm ET on Fox News Channel, with a re-airing at 11pm.

And stay tuned at 9pm ET for "The Next Revolution with Steve Hilton" and at 10pm ET to hear from actor Gary Sinise on "Life, Liberty & Levin."
