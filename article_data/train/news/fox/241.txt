Todd Starnes spoke with John Cox, who won the support of the majority of voters at the California Republican Party to possibly become their candidate for Governor. Cox fell short of the 60% needed to win the California Republican Party's endorsement outright.

Cox told Starnes why his stance on immigration is exactly what California needs. Cox said, "I don't want MS-13 living next to me. This sanctuary state law is all about the Democrats protecting criminals, and I am not going to protect an criminals whatsoever."
