iPhone X users hate Siri, are fine with the notch
Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone X is touted by Cupertino as "the future of the smartphone"â€”and that future includes more screen real estate and the demise of the physical home button.

Indeed, with iPhone X , Apple one-upped thin-bezel phones of the day, like the LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy S8, by extending the screen to the edge of the device at the top and bottom. But to accomodate the powerful cameras needed for its Face ID facial recognition, Apple added a cut-out at the top of the device, known as the notch.

This puzzled some longtime Apple watchers, but the design choice does not appear to bother iPhone X buyers (it even inspired some copycats). According to a study from Creative Strategies and Experian, the phone's design and aesthetics garner almost near-universal praise.

"When it came to overall customer satisfaction, iPhone X owners in our study gave the product an overall 97 percent customer satisfaction," Creative Strategies said, which includes those who were satisfied and very satisified. "In our study, 85 percent of iPhone X owners said they were very satisfied with the product."

Things dropped off only slightly when early iPhone X users were asked about features new to the lineup, such as an OLED display, new swipe gestures, and Face ID. The bigger drop-off in satisfaction was for Portrait Mode and Selfies, though these features are still in beta.

Obviously the big disappointment is Siri. Apple's pioneering voice agent is widely perceived to have fallen behind Amazon's Alexa and the Google Assistant. Google, for example, recently showed off enticing new features for its Assistant, like Google Duplex, which can carry on conversations with humans who are none the wiser. Siri is definitely not there yet, which is likely why its satisfaction rate is at just 20 percent.
