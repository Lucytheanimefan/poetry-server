Former U.S Attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova said Special Counsel Robert Mueller was "not ready" to be called into court by Russian interests he previously indicted.

DiGenova said that at least one of the more than a dozen Russian individuals and companies Mueller indicted earlier this year effectively called his bluff on holding further litigation.

DiGenova said Mueller likely indicted the Russian interests because he "needed something Russian" to be charged in his probe, and that since they are from another country, they would be unlikely to fight back.

"One of the Russian companies sent them to court [over the charges]," diGenova said, adding that Mueller's team then "objected strenuously" to that news.

Tucker Carlson asked if such a situation could be bad for the probe into President Donald Trump.

DiGenova said the judge in the Russians' case told Mueller it must now go to trial since the defendants are willing to litigate.

He said the Russian company wants "a lot of [legal] discovery," which could include documents and the like.

DiGenova said the probe has now become Deputy Attorney General "Rod Rosenstein's monster-in-spades."
