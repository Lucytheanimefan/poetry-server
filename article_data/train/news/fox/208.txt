Political analyst Steve Gill said predictions of a Democrat "blue wave" in the 2018 midterm elections may be far-fetched.

"You can't just run against, you got to run on what you're for," Gill said on the Todd Starnes Radio Show. "And so far the Democrats are just running on hysteria and temper tantrums and that's not going to win in these midterm elections."

Gill, also the founder of the Tennessee Star, said Republicans have a solid chance to hold on to their majorities in the House and the Senate -- especially if Democrats campaign solely on impeaching President Trump.
