Boothe: Trump 'Literally' Making History on North Korea While Media Focuses on Stormy, Russia
'Fully Fixed or Fully Nixed': Netanyahu Says He Trusts Trump to 'Do the Right Thing' on Iran Deal

Lisa Boothe called out the mainstream media's focus on President Trump's controversy with Stormy Daniels and the Russia investigation, saying that it should instead highlight the accomplishments he's making with North Korea.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Monday that Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to accomplish denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.

"You literally have history being made under President Trump, but yet President Obama got a Nobel Peace Prize for doing nothing," Boothe said on "Outnumbered" Tuesday.

Former President Barack Obama was awarded the prize in 2009, for which he was nominated less than two weeks after he took office.

"Essentially, the only thing [Obama] did was get elected," Katie Pavlich said. "If you look at his foreign policy in the seven years following that, it was a complete disaster."

Trump is set to meet with Kim Jong Un in the coming months, and reports say he will not lift sanctions on North Korea unless denuclearization is achieved.

North Korea announced that it would suspend its nuclear and long-range missile tests ahead of the summit.

"It's not getting any attention and he's not getting any credit," Boothe said.
