A scary situation involving the UFC reportedly unfolded in Brazil on Thursday.

Per ESPN.com's Brett Okamoto, UFC President Dana White revealed "several employees and others associated with UFC 224" were held at gunpoint near the host hotel. Okamoto added that UFC employees are "definitely involved," but there have not been any fighters' names mentioned. Those affected have had to cancel stolen credit cards and passports.

Nobody was harmed, and police are involved in the matter. No further details were disclosed.

As UFC.com's Steve Latrell noted, there had been plenty of excitement surrounding the event in the days leading up to fight night. However, safety now takes center stage.

UFC 224 is scheduled to be held at Jeunesse Arena in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday night. Weigh-ins are set for Friday morning.

The Amanda Nunes-Raquel Pennington bout highlights the main card, which features clashes between Ronaldo Souza and Kelvin Gastelum as well as John Lineker vs. Brian Kelleher.
