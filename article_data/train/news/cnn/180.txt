Add Akbar Gbaja-Biamila to the list of athletes and celebrities who have thrown out a terrible first pitch at a Major League Baseball game.

The former NFL linebacker did this prior to Thursday's game at Citizens Bank Park between the San Francisco Giants and Philadelphia Phillies:

There must be a stigma for left-handed ceremonial throwers on a pitcher's mound. MLB's tweet references the infamous first pitch by 50 Cent—who is also a southpaw—for the New York Mets in 2014 that nearly hit a cameraman who was closer to the on-deck circle than home plate.

The good news is Gbaja-Biamila's pitch didn't hurt the Phillies, who swept their four-game series against the Giants with a 6-3 win.
