Seven bodies found at rural property in Australia
(CNN) Seven people, including four children, have been found dead in a rural property in Western Australia, in what's believed to be the country's worst mass shooting in more than two decades.

Officers were called to a residential property in Osmington, around 170 miles (270 kilometers) south of state capital Perth, in the early hours of Friday morning, where the seven bodies were discovered, said Western Australia Police Commissioner Chris Dawson.

Police arrived at the property following a call from "'male person' connected to the property" shortly after 5:00 a.m. local time (5 p.m. Thursday ET), national broadcaster ABC reported.

Five bodies were found inside the house, and the other two outside, close to the property. Dawson described the incident as a "tragedy" and "horrific incident."

Police were treating the incident as a murder-suicide, according to ABC .
