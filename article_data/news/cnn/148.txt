Media martyrs: Among those who died while working as journalists in the past 15 years
Daniel Pearl

Daniel Pearl was the South Asia Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal, based in Mumbai, India. Pearl was reportedly on his way to an interview in Karachi, Pakistan for a story about the “shoe bomber,” Richard Reid, when he was kidnapped on January 23, 2002. Investigators say he was led into a trap, believing he was to meet with Sheikh Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani. His captors demanded better conditions for prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay and threatened to kill Pearl if the demands weren’t met. Pearl was killed sometime between the end of January and early February, though the US government only confirmed Pearl’s beheading on February 21, 2002. Four men were convicted in the case. Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British-born Islamic militant, was sentenced to death, while the other three were given life terms. In 2016, the Pakistani military thwarted a plot to free Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, as suspected mastermind of the 9/11 attacks being held by the United States, has said he personally killed Pearl.
