Dating after cancer means showing up with ‘Fill,’ the bag that collects my waste
It wasn’t until I went on a surfing adventure trip with a nonprofit group called First Descents that I was surrounded by other inspiring and amazing survivors who, like myself, had physical and emotional scars. Though my longtime friends were incredibly supportive as I was fighting the disease, this trip was the first time that I finally spent extended time with young people who understood exactly what I had gone through. They gave me the confidence to wear a bikini and to go surfing with the top of my bag showing, my scars on full display. The trip was life-changing in so many ways. It was there, among my cancer peers, that a new friend suggested the “Fill” nickname for my bag. It has stuck this day. It is crazy to think , after just one week, these people who started as strangers could help me become more secure with my body image and bag.
