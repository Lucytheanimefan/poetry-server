The Australian woman at the center of a controversial rape case sheds anonymity, opens up about consent
It was 2013, and she was out partying with her friend, Brittany Watts, in Kings Cross, a neighborhood in Sydney. The two drank excessively and went to Soho, then a popular nightclub. While on the dancefloor, Watts lost track of her friend, who had been dancing with a male stranger. Mullins ― and everyone following the subsequent rape trial ― later learned his name: Luke Lazarus, the son of one of the club’s owners.
