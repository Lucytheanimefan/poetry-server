#MeToo founder Tarana Burke and comedian Amanda Seales discuss the ‘burden of black womanhood’
About last night at Katy Perry live dinner. I don't take being in these conversations lightly. As a black woman they will far too often consider your intellect a threat and your passion a problem. I hope I inspired others last night to live in your truth no matter who is at the table. Let's grow not just a discourse of love but a DISCOURSE OF COURAGE. Because that's what it takes to face and deliver these inconvenient truths. Made my momma proud last night. Thanks for the love y'all. ❤️✊🏽 [Feel free to RP the vid]
