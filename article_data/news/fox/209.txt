Todd Starnes spoke with famed political strategist Roger Stone about his new book Stone's Rules, who explained how President Trump has been so successful with voters across America.

Stone told Starnes, "He may be a billionaire, but he never lost his Queens, New York roots. And he would rather have lunch with a group of cab drivers than a group of Fortune 500 CEOs. He speaks the language of the streets and the common people."
