Bill Cosby Found Guilty on All Three Counts
Legendary comedian Bill Cosby was found guilty Thursday of drugging and assaulting a woman, capping off the star's slow demise that began in 2014 when dozens of women began accusing the TV icon of sexual assault.

After 14 hours of deliberations, the jury reached a verdict around 1:30 p.m. and determined Cosby was guilty on three counts of felony aggravated indecent assault. The comedian initially had no visible reaction in the courtroom as his fate was announced, but upon hearing the district attorney's request that his bail be revoked he launched into a expletive-laden rant.

The moment happened when District Attorney Kevin Steele argued Cosby's bail was not high enough, prompting Cosby to push away his lawyer's hand and have an outburst during which he shouted that he does not have a private plane and referred to Steele with an expletive.

"I'm sick of him!" Cosby shouted at Steele. The request to have his bail revoked was denied.

Cosby's lawyer, Tom Mesereau, told reporters outside the courthouse: "We don't think Mr. Cosby is guilty of anything and the fight is not over."
