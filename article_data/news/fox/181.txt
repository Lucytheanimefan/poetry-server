Trial to begin for ex-mafia boss charged in 1993 killing
A former New England mafia boss accused of killing a nightclub owner to prevent him from cooperating with authorities 25 years ago is heading to trial.

Opening statements are expected Wednesday in the trial of ex-mafia boss Francis "Cadillac Frank" Salemme and co-defendant Paul Weadick.

Prosecutors say Salemme watched his son strangle Steven DiSarro in 1993 while Weadick held DiSarro's legs off the ground. DiSarro's body wasn't found until 2016. Prosecutors say Salemme was concerned DiSarro would talk to authorities.

Salemme and Weadick deny participating in DiSarro's killing.

Salemme led the New England family of La Cosa Nostra in the early 1990s.

Salemme went into the federal witness protection program while he was a cooperating witness during the prosecution of Boston gangster James "Whitey" Bulger and ex-FBI Agent John Connolly Jr.
