Rudy Guiliani spoke to Todd Starnes about why the $130,000 President Donald Trump reimbursed to his personal attorney Michael Cohen to pay Stormy Daniels was not a campaign finance violation. Additionally, Mr. Giuliani expressed his strong opinions on former FBI Director James Comey.

"I guess the Martha Stewart case would have given you an indication that he was a publicity whore, which he is," Giuliani said. He then added, "Then the whole thing he did with Ashcroft at his bedside, which was for the cameras. I think only somebody like a Clinton would appoint him; you know somebody who is, I won't say anything, but somebody who is, not looking for the most moral character, let's put it that way."
