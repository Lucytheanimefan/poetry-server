Baier on Israel Striking Iranian Targets in Syria: 'Huge Story Is Being Under-Reported'

Bret Baier said Israel's strike on Iranian military infrastructure in Syria is a "huge story" that's being under-reported by much of the media.

The Israeli Defense Force said it deployed fighter jets and used missiles to strike a range of targets, including military compounds, intelligence operations and munitions warehouses following the Islamic Republic's unprovoked rocket attack on soldiers in the Golan Heights.

“The IDF will not allow the Iranian threat to establish itself in Syria. The Syrian regime will be held accountable for everything happening in its territory,” a press release read. “The IDF is prepared for a wide variety of scenarios.”

The strikes were Israel's largest air operation in Syria since the 1973 war.

"We're talking about dozens of Israeli strikes on Iranian military facilities inside Syria," Baier said on "America's Newsroom." "This is probably going to escalate, it is probably going to go into Lebanon."

He said this is the result of U.S. inaction for the past eight years on Iran and Russia's growing influence in Syria.

The White House on Thursday condemned the Iranian assault, two days after President Trump announced he was pulling the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal.

"The United States condemns the Iranian regime's provocative rocket attack from Syria against Israeli citizens, and we strongly support Israel's right to act in self-defense," Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. "The Iranian regime's deployment into Syria of offensive rocket and missile systems aimed at Israel is an unacceptable and highly dangerous development for the entire Middle East."
