Ingraham on Schneiderman Scandal: The Left Was 'Blinded' by Its Anti-Trump Ideology

The U.S. Treasury wants to know how Stormy Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, obtained private banking records of longtime Trump counsel Michael Cohen.

The records show Cohen received hundreds of thousands of dollars from several companies, including one tied to a Russian oligarch, Martha MacCallum reported.

Cohen claimed the documents are inaccurate, when approached by the media while getting into his car.

George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley said it's "hard to make out who's telling the truth here."

He said that some sources claim to have confirmed Avenatti's account that the records are legitimate.

But Turley warned that even if they are, including the one noting a connection to a Russian mogul, they aren't "strong evidence of Russian collusion."

Either way, he said "it doesn't help Cohen."

"It's not good, even in the best case scenario," Turley said.

He said that if the records are accurate, it shows that while President Donald Trump was campaigning on "draining the swamp," his personal attorney was "selling swamp tours" in the form of access to the then-prospective president.

He said the Treasury is right to question whether any laws were broken, but added that he knows Avenatti personally and believes him to be someone that wouldn't intentionally violate federal statutes.
