The retailer branded the initiative as an expansion of its relationship with Amazon. Sears began selling Kenmore appliances on the site in July 2017.

Sears has been struggling to stay afloat for years, closing hundreds of stores as sales suffer in a challenging retail environment. Earlier this year, CEO Eddie Lampert’s hedge fund recommended that the struggling retailer should consider divesting a number of assets, including the Kenmore brand.

The stock is down nearly 98% since closing at an all-time high of $142.51 in April 2007. Shares of Sears were trading around $3.23 on Wednesday.
