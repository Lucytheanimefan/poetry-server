A bizarre YouTube video posted by conspiracy theory channel SecureTeam10 has gone viral as it purportedly shows a UFO sucking energy from a lightning bolt.

The video, entitled "They Dwell in the Lightning," appears to show an object in the sky near a lightning bolt in the Czech Republic. The video was posted 5 days ago and has already racked up nearly 500,000 views.

The herky-jerky footage purportedly shows a "triangular-shaped UFO" following the lightning bolt with ease. Commenters on the video are mixed about what they are seeing, with some claiming it is indeed a UFO, while others believe it's a hoax.
