President Trump to Meet Kim Jong Un for Historic Summit on June 12
President Trump's historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will take place June 12 in Singapore.

The president made the announcement on Twitter just hours after he welcomed home three American prisoners released by Pyongyang.

The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th. We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 10, 2018

Trump -- along with first lady Melania Trump and Vice President Mike Pence -- met Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim when they arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland early Thursday.

Trump publicly thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for releasing the prisoners, and said it is a sign of easing tensions as the two get set to meet on denuclearization in a forthcoming summit.

After the president emerged from a plane with the three Americans, he addressed the media, saying, "I really think he [Kim Jong Un] wants to do something."
