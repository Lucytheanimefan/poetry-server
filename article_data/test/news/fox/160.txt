Loesch: 'Trump Could Cure Cancer, Legacy Media Would Still Find a Way to Attack Him'
Cruz on N. Korea Prisoner Release: Trump Ended Obama Policy of 'Weakness & Appeasement'

NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch said the release of three American prisoners by North Korea is a fantastic victory for President Trump, but the media will still not give credit to him or his administration.

Trump -- along with first lady Melania Trump and Vice President Mike Pence -- met Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim when they arrived at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland early Thursday.

Trump publicly thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for releasing the prisoners, and said it is a sign of easing tensions as the two get set to meet on denuclearization in a forthcoming summit.

On "Fox & Friends," Loesch pointed out that the New York Times bashed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for not appearing with Trump when he pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. Pompeo, however, was actually on his way to North Korea to work on the release of the Americans held captive.

"It feels as though the president could cure cancer and the legacy media could find something over which to attack him," Loesch said.

She said the Times should modify or retract the article, because it's clear the writer was trying to undermine the Trump administration by focusing attention on the "separation" between the president and his secretary of state at a key moment.

"Clearly, Mike Pompeo was acting on behalf of the president. This shows no separation from him or the president’s agenda. It was a goofy headline for them to do," Loesch said.

She said the media may be criticizing the administration because it's been a tremendous week for foreign policy, with the prisoner release, Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Iran deal and the planned opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem on Monday.

"We have an administration that has some strength. We have an administration that's going to follow through on what it promises, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing here," Loesch said. "Who can be mad at this?"
