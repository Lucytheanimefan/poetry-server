Horse knocks out teen's teeth with kick to the face
A teenage girl was knocked unconscious and lost five teeth after being kicked in the face by a horse.

Shocking pictures show battered Georgia Hull, 14, lying in the hospital after she suffered horrific injuries in the freak accident while out trail hunting with friends and family.

Hull was knocked out cold when a horse in front of her kicked out on private land near Wadebridge, Cornwall.

She had to spit her teeth out, while her swollen mouth left her unable to breathe.

She also sustained multiple facial fractures, including severe damage to her jaw, and cuts to her face that have required stitches.

But two weeks on from the incident - and just days after being released from hospital - Hull is already out riding her pony again.

Her horrified mother, Julie Hull, was just ahead of the teen on her own horse when she heard the screams coming from behind.

The air ambulance flew Hull to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, where she spent five days after undergoing four-hour surgery to pin and plate her jaw.

She is still unable to eat solids and has lost five teeth as a result of the kick, and may have to wait until she finishes growing before she can have new ones fixed.

“I was in front and didn’t see it happen, but we were basically just going up a track and the horse in front stopped and double-barrelled her, and caught her in the face. It was pretty scary and traumatic," the teen's 48-year-old mom said. “She was transported up to a field and the Cornwall Air Ambulance took her to Derriford for surgery."

"She’s had a four-hour operation already, and she’s got more to come. She’s lost her teeth at the top but can’t have permanent surgery for implants yet,” she said.

Initially, Hull could only eat through a syringe, but now she is eating pureed foods.

While most teenagers would be left traumatized by such an incident, brave Hull was riding her pony again just days after being discharged from hospital.

“She is really brave, I’m struggling to ride again myself but her pony is her best friend and I think it’s her love of that pony which has got her through this," her mom said. “She is embarrassed about the teeth missing and she’s still got a big lump on her lip and scars where she was stitched, but she never complains."

“She’s happy with her ponies and not like a typical teenager obsessed with make-up and designer clothes," she said. “She can’t chew, and she’s eating mashed up foods and drinking through a straw. But we’re getting there.”

Hull said she wanted to praise the Cornwall Air Ambulance for what they did for her daughter on the day.

“They are absolutely amazing and we can’t manage without them," she said. "It saved an awful lot of time for us that day in getting her to hospital. We’ve got a lot of fundraising going on for the air ambulance as a result of this. The guy who drove Georgia from the track to meet the air ambulance, he has had a long beard for 20 years and at the Royal Cornwall Show he is shaving it off to raise funds."

“Also, there are a lot of people who experienced the accident who are already doing things differently on the safety side," she said.

In the meantime, Georgia’s hunting friends have set up a fundraising page to raise cash to cover the costs of the dental work she needs.

So far nearly £3,400 of the £4,000 target has been raised.
