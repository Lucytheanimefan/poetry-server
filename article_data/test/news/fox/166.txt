NJ Gov. Murphy Allows Illegal Immigrants to Get College Financial Aid, Challenges Trump

Tucker Carlson said Wednesday that "hypocrisy is at the heart of modern liberalism," a fact he said is highlighted in the sudden fall of New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned this week in disgrace.

Schneiderman, a Democrat and -- until Tuesday -- a hero of the #MeToo movement against the mistreatment of women, stands accused of brutally beating multiple women.

"Self-righteousness is always a marker for secret creepiness," Carlson said of Schneiderman, who also made headlines for his lawsuits against then-developer Donald Trump and Trump University.

Carlson said the left is notably a group that can support abortion while claiming to "stand for children," who can demonize an entire race but cry racism, and have a former vice president in Al Gore fly around on a jet while preaching global warming alarmism.

"You can't commit sin if your intentions are pure," Carlson said of the left's belief. "Consistency does not matter to the left. 'We are good people, therefore we must rule.'"

Carlson said liberalism is no longer a political movement but a religious one, a "replacement for the Protestant Christianity liberals worked to destroy."

He said Schneiderman, like other liberals who have been exposed as hypocrites is "marinating in his shame."

"He is a broken man. But on some level, he still knows he's a better person than you are," Carlson said of the former state senator from Manhattan-turned-prosecutor.
