Todd Starnes spoke with Lt. Col. Oliver North, who has recently been named the President of the National Rifle Association. Stares asked Lt. Col North about why he accepted the position and also about the attacks the NRA is facing from anti-gun forces.

Lt. Col. North said, "What we're facing is a frontal assault that uses every lever of power against the NRA. They're using legal attacks. They're using cyberattacks. They're using intimidation and threats and harassment. It's pretty clear to me this is a psychological warfare operation that's being waged."
