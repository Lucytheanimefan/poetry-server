Todd Starnes spoke with Charlie Ebersol, the CEO and Co-founder of the new Alliance of American Football, about why Memphis was chosen to be the home of one of the league's eight teams.

Ebersol said, "When we put the whiteboard up that first day and started writing city names down, Memphis was one of the first three cities that went up on the list entirely because of what kind of culture exists in that city around sports. Honestly, what is it, 'America's biggest small town?' We wanted to be in a place where you can really bring to life what our league is all about, which we think Memphis embodies."
