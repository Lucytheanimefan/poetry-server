After the recently held debate between the leading candidates for Governor of California, Todd Starnes spoke with GOP candidate CA Assemblyman Travis Allen, who stressed the importance of the election in November.

Assemblyman Allen told Starnes, "California used to be the greatest state in the nation. Underneath the Democrats, who have run the legislature for thirty-nine of the last forty years, we now have the nation's highest poverty rate, exploding homelessness that's the highest in the nation, and we have rising violent crime. Underneath the leadership of the Democrats, California has gone dramatically downhill."
