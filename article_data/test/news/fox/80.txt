Trump: 'Very Severe Consequence' If Iran Restarts Its Nuclear Program
Bongino Applauds Trump for Pulling Out of 'Crap' Iran Deal: Obama Got 'Played'

President Donald Trump warned that there will be a "very severe consequence" if Iran restarts its nuclear program.

Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting in the West Wing on Wednesday, Trump was asked about speculation that Iran could resume its attempts to obtain a nuclear weapon following his decision to pull the United States out of the Obama-era nuclear deal.

"I don't think they should do that. I would advise Iran not to start their nuclear program. I would advise them very strongly," Trump said. "If they do, there will be a very severe consequence."

Trump on Tuesday announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal, which lifted most international sanctions against Iran in exchange for the country agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear program and rigorous inspections.

Trump called the deal defective and declared that "America will not be held to nuclear blackmail."

The Iran Deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know what will happen. In just a short time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons.... pic.twitter.com/58qwBLzxIH — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2018

He also noted his recent discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying that the countries are "unified" in understanding the threat Iran is.

"After these consultations, it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the agreement," Trump said.
