Protester Shouting 'Bloody Gina' Removed From CIA Director Confirmation Hearing
McEnany Slams Media's Coverage of Melania: They Attack Anyone Named Trump

A protester was abruptly removed Wednesday from CIA director nominee Gina Haspel's Senate confirmation hearing.

Haspel was speaking to Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) when the woman began shouting from the gallery.

"The question is, what do you do to human beings in U.S. custody? Bloody Gina!," the protester repeatedly shouted. "You are a torturer!"

A short time later another protester disrupted the hearing as Sen. Jack (D-R.I.) asked Haspel about her role in enhanced interrogations of terror suspects

The man was hauled out by Capitol Police officers and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said any individuals involved in future disruptions would also be removed.

Some Democrats have said Haspel should be disqualified because of her involvement in what critics consider to be the torture of two terrorism suspects at a covert detention site in Thailand.

More than 50 former top national-security and intelligence officials - including vocal Trump critics - have expressed support for Haspel, who would be the first female CIA director.
