Bolton: With Iran Deal Exit, Trump Sent 'Very Important' Message to North Korea
'So Misguided': Obama Criticizes Trump Decision to Exit Iran Nuclear Deal

White House National Security Adviser John Bolton pushed back on Democrats who argued that by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, the United States will be deemed untrustworthy when it comes to North Korea.

President Trump on Tuesday announced his decision to exit the agreement, noting that although it lifted economic sanctions on Iran, it set very "weak" limits on the regime's nuclear activity.

The announcement was met with backlash from a number of high-profile Democrats, including former President Barack Obama, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and former Secretary of State John Kerry.

Obama called the decision "so misguided" and Pelosi reacted by saying it “endangers global security and defies comprehension.”

"They're completely wrong. We had a rotten deal Iran," Bolton said on "Fox & Friends."

"I think it sends a very important message to North Korea that we're not in these negotiations with them just to get a deal," he said.

North Korea released three American prisoners Wednesday, handing them over to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The release comes as the president continues to prepare for his upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

"We're going to get the right deal," Bolton added.
