White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders ripped the New York Times and other media outlets for what she considered slanted reporting about the Trump administration.

"I think it's shameful what the media sometimes does," she told Martha MacCallum.

Sanders pointed to a Times report that described Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as AWOL while Trump was making important decisions on Iran.

Sanders said that at the time, Pompeo was negotiating the release of three American hostages in North Korea, a mission that was eventually fruitful.

MacCallum showed live pictures of Pompeo's jet landing in Anchorage, Alaska, on Wednesday.

"How clueless can the media be?" Sanders asked, adding that Pompeo was doing "exactly [the] job he is supposed to do."
