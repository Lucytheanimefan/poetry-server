Todd Starnes spoke with Mark Hancock, the CEO of the faith-based outdoor adventure ministry Trail Life USA, about why it's important for boys to have a place where they can act like boys in the face of changes to organizations like The Boy Scouts of America.

Hancock said, "We forget that boyhood is not some sort of social disease that needs to be eradicated. That drive and daring of healthy boys is exactly what's responsible for much of what is right with society, because they become determined, focused, and winning men."
