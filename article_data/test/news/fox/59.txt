The 2018 Billboard Music Awards are almost here.

The awards show -- which is slated to feature several star performances -- will take place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 20.

Here’s what you should know ahead of the big event.

Where can I watch the 2018 Billboard Music Awards?

You can catch the awards on NBC at 8 p.m. ET.

Tickets for the Sin City event can also be bought online.

Who is hosting?

Singer Kelly Clarkson will emcee the Billboard Music Awards.

“I already have 20 costume changes planned,” Clarkson said in a statement last month. “I will be flying in like my girl P!nk, and calling Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman for jokes.”

She continued, “Well, or I’m just gonna show up and celebrate my favorite artists and get to know a few more. Yeah, maybe I’ll go with that plan.”

Clarkson is also set to perform during the program.

What about the other artists performing?

Ariana Grande is going to kick off the awards show “with a show-stopping performance from her upcoming LP,” a press release stated.

The show will also feature a duet performance from Christina Aguilera and Demi Lovato. They’ll perform the tune “Fall in Line.”

K-pop band BTS -- along with pop stars Camila Cabello, John Legend, Dua Lipa, Jennifer Lopez and Shawn Mendes -- have all been announced, too.

How are award finalists determined?

“Billboard Music Awards nominees and winners are based on key fan interactions with music, including album and digital song sales, streaming, radio airplay, touring and social engagement, tracked by Billboard and its data partners, including Nielsen Music and Next Big Sound,” a May 7 press release explained. “The awards are based on the reporting period of April 8, 2017 through March 31, 2018.”

The Billboard Chart Achievement Award and the Top Social Artist Award are both voted on by fans.

Who's up for Top Artist?

Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift have all been nominated for the award.

What about the Top New Artist nominees?

This year’s nominees include Camila Cabello, R&B singer Khalid, plus rappers 21 Savage, Cardi B and Kodak Black.

Who is getting the Billboard Icon Award?

Janet Jackson. The artist will also reward fans with a performance on the live telecast -- her first televised performance in 9 years.

“I can’t wait!” the singer said in a May 7 tweet.

Past award recipients include Prince, Stevie Wonder, Cher, Neil Diamond, Celine Dion and Jennifer Lopez.

Jackson has been a dominant force on the Billboard charts for decades, thanks to hits including “That’s The Way Love Goes,” “I Get Lonely” and “All for You.”

The multi-platinum superstar will kick off another leg of her State of the World Tour in July.
