Former professional wrestler Kane, whose real name is Glenn Jacobs, won the Knox County, Tennessee Republican mayoral primary Tuesday.

Jacobs spoke with Neil Cavuto about his win and his platform for the residents of Knoxville and the surrounding area if he is able to win again in November.

Jacobs bested fellow Republicans Bob Thomas and Brad Anders by 17 votes.

"I just want to see my area become an even better place," Jacobs said. "I think that I can have a small part in doing that."

Jacobs said he sees himself as a "Ron Paul conservative" and added that he is pleased with the work of President Donald Trump.

"Trump's done a very good job, especially with the economy," Jacobs said. "As Republicans we have to stick by what we believe in and that is fiscal conservatism and individual freedom."

Cavuto pointed out that "Kane" had a very successful career in wrestling, and noted that he didn't necessarily "need" the stress of elected office.

Jacobs said he wanted to be a different type of Republican politician, and that people like him are needed in public office.

"When Republicans are in positions of power, they forget about [conservative principles]," Jacobs said.

Cavuto said he also extended an interview invitation for the Democrat in the race, Linda Haney.
