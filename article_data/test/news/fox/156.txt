NJ Gov. Murphy Allows Illegal Immigrants to Get College Financial Aid, Challenges Trump

The Treasury Department's inspector general is investigating whether Stormy Daniels' attorney Michael Avenatti obtained Michael Cohen's confidential bank records through a leak.

Avenatti denies he obtained the records improperly or that he published false information.

He revealed this week that, according to the records, Cohen was paid by AT&T, pharmaceutical giant Novartis and a firm linked to a Russian oligarch, alleging that Cohen was selling access to his longtime top legal client President Trump.

WOW. Evidently, the personal attorney to Mr. Trump (NOT a lobbying firm) was actively soliciting clients and trying to sell access to the highest office in the land. Maybe this is why the SDNY case is with the Public Corruption division of the U.S. Attys Office. #basta https://t.co/yEHThVCMLh — Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) May 9, 2018

When asked how he obtained the documents he published Tuesday, Avenatti told Fox News: "That’s my work product and will not be disclosed."

Judge Andrew Napolitano weighed in on "Outnumbered Overtime," explaining that he does not believe Avenatti "committed wrongdoing."

"Who in the Treasury Department caused these documents to get into Mr. Avenatti's hands? Whoever that was certainly violated Treasury regulations and may have violated federal law," he said.

"I don't believe Mr. Avenatti committed any wrongdoing, but the person who put [the documents] in his hands undoubtedly did."

He said Avenatti could argue that he was acting as a member of the media and was thus allowed to reveal the information because the contents are in the "public interest," like the Pentagon Papers.

Napolitano said the government may argue that Cohen "promised access" to Trump in exchange for millions of dollars, including from foreign entities.

"When you're dealing with foreign entities, you have to register as a foreign agent, which Mr. Cohen did not do," Napolitano added.

He said President Trump would be "off the hook" if he did not know Cohen was promising such access.

Watch the discussion above.
