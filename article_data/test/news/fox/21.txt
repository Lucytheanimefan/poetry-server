Jesse Watters reacted Thursday to President Donald Trump successfully retrieving three Americans held in North Korean labor camps.

Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim all landed at Andrews Air Force Base in Camp Springs, Md. overnight where they were met by President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump.

Watters remarked on "The Five" that Trump did "the opposite" of what President Obama did to retrieve soldier Bowe Bergdahl from the Taliban. Obama traded five convicted terrorists for Bergdahl, who later pleaded guilty to desertion.

He said that Trump has a habit of doing the opposite of his predecessor, in what he called the "George Costanza method," in a nod to NBC's "Seinfeld."

In a May 1994 episode of the famous sitcom, Costanza, played by Jason Alexander, is upset at the way his life is trending and decides to take action while ordering lunch with friends Jerry and Elaine at his favorite diner.

After ordering his usual "tuna on toast," he calls the waitress back to order the "complete opposite" in hopes of changing his overall fate. While deciding to order "chicken salad on rye, untoasted, with a cup of tea," he catches the eye of a potential love interest who tells him she ordered the same exact thing.

"Whenever Obama did something, Trump does the opposite," Watters said.

He added that whenever Trump does so, he tends to produce key results for the United States, in the way Costanza was able to improve his own life in a small way.
