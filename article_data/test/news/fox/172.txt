Todd Starnes spoke with Mark Harris, the pastor who defeated three-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Robert Pittenger in a GOP congressional primary rematch in North Carolina's Ninth District.

Harris told Starnes about how he was able to pull off the upset. Harris said, My challenge to (Pittenger) was that Congress has been slow walking many of the things that President Trump championed and wanted to do, and I'm going to be a full supporter of this President. All of these things that were priorities that this President set out, we need a Congress that's going to come along beside him and move these agenda items forward."
