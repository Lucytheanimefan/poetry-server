Sgt. Nick Irving, an author and former Army Ranger sniper, praised CIA Director nominee Gina Haspel, calling on critics to acknowledge she helped stop attacks on Americans after 9/11.

Haspel, a three-decade CIA veteran, faced tough questioning from Senate Democrats over her past role in enhanced interrogations of terror suspects.

Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) repeatedly pressed Haspel for a yes-or-no answer on whether the techniques were "immoral," but Haspel refused to give such an answer.

Brian Kilmeade and Irving agreed that Haspel and other U.S. intelligence officers helped thwart further terror attacks with the information gained in interrogations.

"No one complained about we got the job done back then. Watching innocent moms and dads jump from those towers, it's hard to forget. How we get the job done is how we get it done," he said, arguing Americans are forgetting the post-9/11 world and only viewing the situation at a "bumper sticker" level.

"We need to get back on track and let the guys do their job."

Irving, who served six deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan and is one of the war on terror's deadliest snipers, said Army Rangers and other U.S. special operators must capture high-value terror targets and find out what they know.

"We do bad things to bad people. We have not deterred from that. We're pretty good at what we do," said Irving, adding special forces soldiers "look up to" leaders like Gina Haspel.

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a victim of torture as a POW during the Vietnam War, opposes Haspel's nomination because of her past participation in interrogations at a so-called CIA black site in Thailand.

I believe Gina Haspel is a patriot who loves our country & has devoted her professional life to its service & defense. However, her role in overseeing the use of torture is disturbing & her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying. https://t.co/ocDtdqU2Sx — John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) May 10, 2018
