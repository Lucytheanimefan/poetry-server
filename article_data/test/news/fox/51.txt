Discounts deepen as sedans fall out of favor
next

prev

Over the past few years, car shoppers have flocked to crossovers and SUVs because of their higher seating position, added cargo space and ease of entry. As a result, sedan sales have slowed to a crawl. Things are so bad that Ford last month announced plans to stop selling most of its sedans in North America by 2022.

Right now, though, the lack of love for sedans is good news for bargain-hunting car shoppers. Slow-selling four-door models are being heavily discounted, and those who can live without an SUV can find excellent deals.

The following sedans make our list because all of them have sat on dealers' lots for an average of 90 days or longer. The average 2018 vehicle's "days to turn" is 61. We then looked at the average discount off the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). (The MSRP shown is the average for all of a model's trim levels, weighted toward what is most commonly sold.) Not all of these cars are best in class, but they are solid vehicles that get even more attractive when you factor in the available deals.

Some of these savings are based on finance incentives and others on lease specials. In either case, dealers are eager to sell and willing to offer you a deal. Some vehicles on the list have more than one engine to choose from, which means the savings will vary depending on the popularity of that option. The less popular the engine, the higher the chances of you getting a better deal.

2018 ACURA TLX

Average MSRP: $40,037. Average savings: $4,214.

This entry-level premium sedan isn't the most exciting model around, but it offers an attractive value proposition. The TLX 2.4L with the Technology package, for instance, gets you features such as leather seats, a premium audio system, and a suite of advanced driver safety aids as standard equipment.

2018 CHEVORLET IMPALA

Average MSRP: $35,271. Average savings: $1,980.

The Impala has a comfortable ride, plenty of room for rear passengers and a trunk that's one of the largest in any sedan. It's also quiet at highway speeds and has plenty of power when equipped with the optional V6 engine.

2018 DODGE CHARGER

Average MSRP: $40,854. Average savings: $1,449.

The Charger is for drivers who want a car that looks cool, sounds good, and comes in colors with such names as Go Mango, Maximum Steel and White Knuckle. It's also a car for drivers who crave power. A V6 engine is the default engine, but you can get a V8 with so much power that it might qualify for NASCAR duty. Just don't expect any crazy discounts on the rarer, low-volume Charger Hellcat.

2018 TOYOTA AVALON

Average MSRP: $39,180. Average savings: $3,442.

The Avalon combines comfort, quality, a roomy interior and impressive fuel economy, all of which make it one of the best large sedans on the market. A cushioned ride and quiet cabin make it well-suited for commutes and road trips. Keep in mind that the fully redesigned 2019 Toyota Avalon will be in dealerships soon.

2018 TOYOTA AVALON HYBRID

Average MSRP: $42,454. Average savings: $3,991.

If you like what the Avalon has to offer but want better fuel economy, the hybrid version offers 40 mpg in combined driving, a figure that few SUVs can rival.

2018 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT

Average MSRP: $27,588. Average savings: $2,392.

The Passat isn't the go-to sedan if you're seeking flash and flair, but its roomy cabin, easy-to-drive nature and large, utilitarian trunk make it an excellent family car and one that's good for around-town driving or long-distance road trips.

EDMUNDS SAYS: There's still plenty to like about sedans. And if you're open to new brands and models, the savings could send you home happy.
