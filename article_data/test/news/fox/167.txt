Sean Hannity ripped Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee who critiqued Gina Haspel, the nominee to run the CIA, for being what he called "too tough on terrorists."

Hannity said Haspel worked at a high level in the CIA while terror suspects were interrogated with "enhanced" techniques at black sites.

Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden asked Haspel to go "on the record" as to whether she ever asked for the waterboarding program to "be continued."

Hannity slammed Wyden, saying that Haspel was "doing her job."

Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed later asked Haspel how she would "determine" waterboarding to be "immoral" if it were done to a captured CIA officer.

Hannity said Reed, Wyden and others who are critical of waterboarding terrorists should view the video of the beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.

He said suspected 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed personally beheaded Pearl and published the video.

Haspel said there is "no comparison" between what Mohammed did to Pearl and what CIA agents did to terrorists and terror suspects.

Hannity said Mohammed asked a military judge at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to send along information the terrorist wrote for the committee to view during Haspel's nomination.

"Unbelievable, despicable and disgusting," Hannity said in characterizing the entire ordeal.

On 9/11, "we lost 3,000 Americans," Hannity said, questioning why Democrats like Reed and Wyden would take umbrage at talk of interrogating terrorists.
