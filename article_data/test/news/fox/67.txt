Farrah Fawcett's son Redmond O'Neal arrested after robbing local store at knifepoint, cops say
The son of Ryan O'Neal and the late Farrah Fawcett, Redmond O'Neal, was arrested for allegedly robbing a Los Angeles convenience store and holding up the store clerk with a knife in the wee hours Tuesday morning.

The Los Angeles Police Departement told Fox News that O'Neal walked into a Santa Monica 7-Eleven where he allegedly threatened the store clerk with a knife and demanded that he hand him the money from the convenience store's register.

A call was then placed to the cops around 2:30 a.m. that Tuesday morning about the incident.

O'Neal allegedly fled the scene but the 33-year-old didn't get too far. The cops quickly arrived and arrested him. The LAPD told Fox News that when they stopped O'Neal they found a knife on his person. O'Neal's case will now be turned over to the district attorney. He is currently being held on a $50,000 bail.

The Hollywood superstars' son's arrest is not his first (or second or third) run-in with the law.

O'Neal has a history of drug addiction through most of his adult life.

In 2015, O'Neal was sentenced to three years in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for violating his probation related to an earlier drug-possession conviction.

O'Neal's half-sister Tatum O'Neal told People at the time, “I love him, but I have never seen a more scary side of addiction. He’s got addiction problems so bad that it breaks my heart. Nobody knows what to do with Redmond. From what I’ve seen, there is no way he’s going to survive.”

And back in 2011, O'Neal's probation was revoked after he admitted to using narcotics while in court-ordered rehab. He was sentenced to a year in rehab after he pled no contest to felony gun and heroin possession a month before.

According to People, that same year, O'Neal's father, Ryan, said that his son “never recovered from the loss of his mother."

Fawcett passed away in 2009. She died after battling cancer at the age of 62.
