Trump Says U.S.-North Korea Summit Set for June 12 in Singapore
“We’re starting off on a new footing,” Mr. Trump said early on Thursday.

Mr. Trump hopes to convince Mr. Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons and the missiles that can carry them. When Mr. Trump greeted the hostages in the early morning hours, he told reporters that his proudest achievement will be “when we denuclearize that entire peninsula.”

“Hopefully everything is going to work out at the highest level,” Mr. Trump said earlier on Thursday. “We want to thank Kim Jong-un, who really was excellent to these three incredible people.”

The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, of New York, said he could not understand the praise Mr. Kim was receiving from Mr. Trump and others for releasing the three prisoners.

“We can’t be fooled into giving the North Korean regime credit for returning Americans that never should have been detained in the first place. American citizens are not diplomatic bargaining chips,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor on Thursday. “So while we celebrate the return of the three Americans for the sake of their freedom and their families, we should not feel like we need to give Kim Jong-un anything in return.”

The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, congratulated the Trump administration for what he described as a “significant step.”
