Read Any Antisocial Novels Lately?
These days, reading autofiction can feel a bit like trying to meditate while a fire alarm is going off. Jolted from our reveries by the more brutal stories of the merciless, news-cycle variety, it’s as though we’ve woken from a beautiful dream to realize that having once elected an idealistic black president did not in fact ensure that other revolutions would quickly follow, and indeed that certain structures of power, soft and hard, remain all the more firmly entrenched and internalized. That enlightenment has been co-opted as just another branding concept to sell us water or yoga clothes. That all of our considered noticing and contemplation may have simply led us to a pained awareness that the particularity of our gaze and insight doesn’t count for much against a rigged system, much less a disaffected young man carrying an AR-15.

Though the wandering existential stories of the last decade may have begun to outwear their potency, they have given rise to a wave of new ones underwritten with restless anxiety and rage, unembarrassed in their fundamentally tragic outlook. Call it the antisocial novel. This new, less dilatory mode doesn’t ask to be understood, but haunts us with a bleakly dead-on, diffident humor about the pain of being alive. It doesn’t perambulate, but plummets with the graceful inevitability of a shot bird. It features characters, mostly women clinging to the edge of the map, who fail to act in their own best interests, who don’t have the kind of self-belief that would allow them to find grandeur in their private struggles.

And yet here they are, vibrantly extant: a young woman bankrupted by a bogus alternative therapy who takes a job as a professional girlfriend (Catherine Lacey’s “The Answers”), a pot-dealing mother of three addled by lurid fears real and imagined (Samantha Hunt’s “A Love Story”), a graduate student who loses her funding and resorts to living out of her car (Lauren Groff’s “Above and Below”), an artist caving to pressure to produce work of deliberate ugliness in order to be nominated for the Turner Prize (Helen DeWitt’s “Brutto”), an inmate serving two life sentences at a women’s prison in California (Rachel Kushner’s “The Mars Room”). These women aren’t out fighting the doomed fight against a broken society, like the characters in recent dystopic novels by male authors (Ben H. Winters’s “Underground Airlines,” Michael Tolkin’s “NK3,” Omar El Akkad’s “American War”); they’re confined by it, literally or metaphorically rattling their cages. They’re fighting mostly against themselves. Less concerned with questions of form and style than their autofiction forebears, these novels and stories suggest that fiction has finally begun to move from its place of deep solipsism to address a deepening sense of futility. They are, by and large, horror stories, and what makes them horrifying is not that they make our dystopian imaginings plausible, but that they show us how real they have become: that the social contract has dissolved, venality and perversity have won, and all the effort we’ve made to see ourselves clearly might not save us after all.

AUTOFICTION HAS ALWAYS been in large part about the failures of story. Born of a weariness with conventions like plot and character, it had a healthy skepticism for the ways we arrange experience into narrative — especially the idea of life as a redemptive “journey,” a word that has been so ruined it can now only be used by bad screenwriters and contestants on “The Bachelor.” While diverse in experimentation and degrees of curatorial artifice — a single term strains to contain writers as varied as W.G. Sebald, Elif Batuman, Ben Lerner, Jenny Offill, Rachel Cusk and Karl Ove Knausgaard, to name just a few — autofiction sought to nudge the mirror of the page closer to the soul with transparent subjectivity: It wanted to be realer, less contrived and perhaps more democratic. Crucially, it recognized the impact of storytelling on how we understand our own lives, helping to reveal the terribly reductive nature of certain old stories, in which women found themselves turned into plot devices or dead bodies, and people of color often looked in vain for recognizable versions of themselves. It helped us see through writers and directors who wrapped their misogyny in irony or self-loathing. Even at its most solipsistic, autofiction generally reached outward as it looked inward, and this was irresistible, the belief that small could be large, that life contained grace notes of heroism, that there could be something universal in our individual experiences. As the smartphone took over intimate corners of life, it felt almost compulsive, this need to be more genuinely heard — a compulsion Cusk used to ingenious effect in 2014’s “Outline” and the two novels that followed it, by creating a narrator who was, indelibly, an incisive filter for the stories of others.
