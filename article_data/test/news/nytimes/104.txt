The Double-Layer Chocolate Cake I Make for My Son’s Birthday
What wasn’t shared, what I selfishly kept to myself, was the immense happiness I felt as I baked something that would mark a milestone for someone I loved inordinately. For all the baking that I did, making a birthday cake was different. Being in the kitchen measuring and mixing, filling, frosting and finishing the cake gave me time to think about my son and the year that had passed. Had I kept a journal, I might have read it on his birthday. Instead, I baked.

One year, maybe it was when he turned 11, I baked a double-layer chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and, because he loved it so much, it became the birthday cake, one I make only for his birthday. Over the course of a couple of decades, I’ve tweaked the recipe here and there, but it remains essentially the same. The cake itself is dark and chocolate through and through, a devil’s-food cake that’s good cold (when it’s easiest to slice) and at room temperature (which is what it usually is by the time everyone’s been served a piece). This cake has nothing to do with what I had as a child — while I always had cake, I never had one that was homemade, nor did I ever have the same cake twice — and yet, to me, it tastes old-fashioned. It gets its color and flavor from both cocoa powder and melted bittersweet chocolate, as does the frosting, an all-American butter cream that fills the layers generously. Straight from the bowl, the frosting is soft and billowy, the right texture to spread across the top of the cake in swirls and waves, the right consistency to capture and hold onto sprinkles, crushed cocoa nibs, toasted nuts or tiny candies. It’s a kid’s cake that gets grown-ups remembering their own childhoods — noisy birthday parties with silly decorations and games, the cold milk that always came with the cake and the inevitability of leaving the table with chocolate-smudged lips.
