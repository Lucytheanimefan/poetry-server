Malaysia’s Election: What Happened, and What’s Next
HONG KONG — The official opposition victory in Malaysia’s election on Wednesday has put a new focus on the country’s political system, which has been dominated by one party since independence.

Here’s a look at the central questions about Malaysia’s political system and important figures in the political sphere.

Who won?

Mahathir Mohamad, a 92-year-old former prime minister, led an opposition coalition to victory over his former protégé, Prime Minister Najib Razak. Mr. Mahathir served as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, a period of strong growth followed by the Asian financial crisis, from which the country recovered after rejecting austerity policies.

Mr. Mahathir was known for his autocratic tendencies, advocacy of Asian exceptionalism and occasional anti-Semitic jibes that prompted international condemnation. His electoral victory this week required that he work with some of the opposition figures who were his rivals in past decades.
