Review: ‘Breaking In’ Finds Gabrielle Union as a Mother on a Mission
A paint-by-number plot still leads to an entertaining picture in “Breaking In.” Here, you get what you expect, but it’s a little better than you may have anticipated.

Much of that is thanks to Gabrielle Union, who stars as Shaun, a mother arriving with her two children at a remote Wisconsin house. Her recently murdered father owned the place and hid some ill-gotten gains inside. A crew of crooks, who didn’t plan on visitors, is already there to steal the loot.

Soon, those creeps have seized the kids (Ajiona Alexus and Seth Carr) and locked Shaun out of this high-security home. You can bet she’ll use all of its blatantly foreshadowed gizmos, along with her own supply of smarts, to get back in and save her brood.
