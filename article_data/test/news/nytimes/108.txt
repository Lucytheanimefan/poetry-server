Meet the New York Times’s Most Devoted Letter Writers
Ms. Mermelstein and Mr. Feyer wanted to bring these writers together. So last Thursday, The Times invited its most dedicated letter writers to an event at the newspaper’s Manhattan headquarters. Guests came from as close as New York City and as far as Sitges, Spain.

The crowd skewed 50-plus. “There was a fair amount of gray hair. Including yours truly,” Mr. Feyer said.

The Times has accepted letters to the editor since the paper was founded in 1851. When Adolph S. Ochs bought the paper in 1896, one aim, he wrote, was “to make the columns of The New York Times a forum for the consideration of all questions of public importance, and to that end to invite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion.”

Only a handful are selected for publication each day. But some letter writers are especially prolific: Louis Jay Herman, a linguist and United Nations translator, had more than 100 published in his lifetime, a fact that made it into his obituary. Felicia Nimue Ackerman, a philosophy professor at Brown University, has successfully submitted over 300; her efforts earned her a write-up in The New Yorker.

“We’re what’s called cranks,” said William Cole, 55, a rare-art and book dealer based in Sitges, Spain. He drew a distinction between the sort of people who write letters and those who don’t: “Anybody with any sort of reasonable level of maturity I suppose would simply say, ‘That’s just wrong.’ I think there are certain kinds of people who say, ‘This is wrong, I want to write something about it.’ ”
