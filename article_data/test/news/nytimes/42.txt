36 Hours in Gothenburg, Sweden
Saturday

5) 10 a.m. PARK LIFE

Start the day at Slottsskogen, a vast park south of the city center. The hilly, half-square-mile expanse of meadows, forests and wooded trails also features a series of animal enclosures, mainly of Nordic species like majestic elk, horned goats and Oland geese. But don’t miss the pool of seals corkscrewing through the water, or the adorable waddle of Humboldt penguins, a threatened species. In warmer months, there’s also a free petting zoo with native sheep, goats and rabbits, and pony rides on the herd of diminutive Gotlandsruss (20 kronor). While wandering through the woods, take advantage of the free dendrology lessons: Informative signs detail the characteristics of the surrounding linden, beech, maple and oak trees.

6) Noon. SOUND LUNCH

Hoga Nord is a local record label that produces limited-edition vinyl for music distinctly outside the mainstream (give Pete Bassman or Pistol Disco a listen). In 2016, its offerings expanded with the opening of Kafé Hoga Nord, a soup and smorrebrod (open-faced sandwich) cafe adjacent to the label’s record shop. Pair the daily soup — creamy cauliflower with roasted hazelnuts was a recent special — with one of the vegetarian smorrebrod, like toast topped with crisp romesco-slathered cabbage, adzuki beans, almonds and shavings of Spanish goat cheese (110 kronor). Then see to expanding your music collection next door.

7) 1:30 p.m. ART SCENE

The large-scale street art murals splashed on walls, doorways and garages around town are not random graffiti, but an urban beautification project called ArtMadeThis. This series of paintings, all by female artists, began in Gothenburg in 2015 and has since spread to three other cities (and one municipality). Two works to seek out: the exuberant bee-rider by Mimmi Andersson and Merete Lassen at Kungsgatan 65, and Ebba Chambert’s mystical goddesses at Vallgatan 22.
