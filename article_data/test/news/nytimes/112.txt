The Eclectic Tastes of Andre Walker
“My parents were clotheshorses,” says the New York-born fashion designer Andre Walker, remembering the wide-lapeled sport coats his father would import from the London tailor Cecil Gee. Walker shared their interest from a young age, poring over his mother’s issues of W magazine and selling his own designs — hand-painted T-shirts and repurposed medical scrubs promoting his imaginary band, “Jimmy Sick and the Anemics” — on the streets of Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, when he was just 13. Two years later, in 1981, Walker launched his first runway collection of androgynous shifts and jackets at the neighborhood nightclub Oasis.

And so began a 37-year career, during which Walker has designed for the likes of Marc Jacobs and men’s designer Kim Jones while keeping his own name alive by collaborating on special one-off collections with brands such as Comme des Garçons. Last fall, he remade a number of his early silhouettes — draped, billowing floor-length capes and tunics — for a collection with Pendleton that showed in Paris, and he recently completed sketches for an upcoming collection for Virgil Abloh’s Off-White.

Now, at 52, Walker is contemplating his next move, perhaps as the creative director of a house other than his own. He’s a man of eclectic tastes, appreciating everything from the angular designs of ’80s hair artist Robert Lobetta to the illustrated children’s books of the 20th-century British poet Ruth Manning-Sanders. And yet he doesn’t like his influences to be too evident. “Sometimes I feel inarticulate because I’m working so hard to avoid the reference. I like things that appear to have come from nothing,” he says. Still, Walker is preoccupied with questions of creation, whether they concern a belted coat or the universe as a whole. This, too, is part of his inheritance: Walker’s mother is a hairdresser and a pastor, and, in addition to owning a record store, his late father was an ordained minister. “I like to think I’m striving for conceptual purism, for an ethereal kind of ideal.”

Here, Walker shares some of his many inspirations.
