Rep. Tenney’s Fervor for Trump Invites Ridicule, but Not From Voters
The sprawling district is as Republican as any in the state, with registered Republicans outnumbering registered Democrats by some 30,000. But political observers say the district skews to the center of the political spectrum, citing moderate Republicans who have held the House seat in the past.

Yet interviews with more than a dozen voters revealed that Ms. Tenney’s red-meat conservatism — and stance on issues ranging from gun rights to tax cuts to small government — are resonating in the age of Trump.

Even her most contentious remark about the Democratic leanings of mass shooters earned high marks from some Republicans. (The nonpartisan PolitiFact rated the claim a “Pants on Fire” fabrication.)

“My opinion is that if that’s the truth, then God bless her for saying it,” said Grant Becker, the 30-year-old son of a dairy farmer who works in a machine shop in Little Falls. “If it’s not true, then she shouldn’t have, but I believe it’s true and I support her 100 percent.”

Ms. Tenney, 57, is a lawyer and former state assemblywoman who lives in New Hartford, a suburb of Utica. One Republican strategist described her as “Trump before Trump.”

But if Democrats were hoping that Ms. Tenney’s inflammatory remarks — mostly made in local radio interviews — would turn the tide toward Mr. Brindisi, they may be disappointed. All eight of the Republican county committees that span the 22nd House district have endorsed her re-election campaign.

From midsized cities like Utica to rural hamlets, many Republicans defended her comments as refreshing, while others said they were irrelevant, arguing that they were in line with today’s overheated political discourse.
