How to Make an Art Fair Part of Your Next Vacation
Whether it’s ZONAMACO, in Mexico City, The Armory Show, in New York, or Art Basel, held in Basel, Switzerland, Miami Beach and Hong Kong, art fairs are more accessible and popular than ever. Attending a fair should be a part of any travel itinerary, according to Natasha Schlesinger, art historian and founder of ArtMuse, a company that offers private tours of art fairs in New York City and Europe.

“Art fairs are opportunities for people to see and learn about art just as they would if they were visiting a museum,” she said. “You don’t have to be a buyer to attend.”

Here are a few of her tips to make your visit to an art fair an enjoyable experience.

Think About the Art You’re Most Interested In

Art fairs are focused on different genres, including contemporary art, old master paintings and photography. When you decide which fairs to attend, hone in on the style of art that you find most appealing.

“Some cities such as New York have so many fairs that selecting which you want to go to can be challenging,” Ms. Schlesinger said. “Picking based on art you like will help narrow down the choices.”
