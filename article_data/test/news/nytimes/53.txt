Opinion | Napping While Black (and Other Transgressions)
But even thousands of miles from home, one constant remained: I was constantly made aware of the color of my skin.

I was regularly asked if I was a prostitute in broad daylight, asked how much I cost while walking to class. I was pushed off a bus twice by angry old men. I was spat at. I was once locked in a taxi and propositioned by the driver. I got out only when I started to scream and hit the windows.

While subletting an apartment for a summer, the landlord came to pick up the rent money (this is common in Italy), and instead of just taking the money and giving me a receipt, he said I could keep my money if I just “had a little fun” with him. I declined, threw the money on the table and left the apartment. When I told the white student that I’d sublet the apartment from, she was skeptical and said she had never had any problems with the man.

In this environment, the campus, its supportive professors and the group of friends I found became a haven. But on a few occasions, it felt like the nastiness outside the school found its way in.

My junior year, I took a rigorous course that nearly everyone dropped after the first week. One day, the professor asked me a question and my response fell short. He laughed. I later learned he had posted about the response on his Facebook account, calling out students who ask silly questions. The same professor later told me he was “surprised” I got into Columbia Journalism School.

A few weeks after I received that message, a different professor accused me of plagiarizing a history paper. I showed him my sources; it was clear I hadn’t done so.

I loved school and wanted to shrug off these experiences. But while I could chalk up the hostility on the street to Italian culture, in the classroom, I was surrounded by Americans. And the truth is that my white friends weren’t being questioned about the validity of their work or asked to prove that they deserved to be there.
