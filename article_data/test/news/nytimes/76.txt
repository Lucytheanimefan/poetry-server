Review: In ‘The Seagull,’ a Great Play, a Great Cast and Yet ...
Watching Annette Bening as Irina Arkadina in “The Seagull,” Michael Mayer’s adaptation of the durable Anton Chekhov play, you might almost believe that the role was written with her in mind. There is very little Ms. Bening can’t do, but one of the things she does best is play actresses — the title character in “Being Julia,” Gloria Grahame in “Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool” and now Chekhov’s diva of the late-19th-century Moscow stage. Irina is charming and silly, imperious and intelligent, tough to the point of cruelty and also exquisitely sensitive. Her brother’s country estate, where nearly all of the drama takes place, is a hive of shifting loyalty, jealousy and desire, dominated by Irina’s grand and difficult personality.

Ms. Bening may be the straw that stirs this particular drink, but she is hardly the only marvel in a cast that includes Corey Stoll (as Irina’s lover, the celebrated writer Boris Trigorin), Brian Dennehy (as Sorin, Irina’s perpetually dying brother) and Elisabeth Moss (as the cynical and lovelorn Masha, daughter of the estate manager). Supplying the requisite notes of youthful ardor are Billy Howle, as Irina’s melancholy son, Konstantin, and Saoirse Ronan, as Nina, the young neighbor he tormentedly loves. (Mr. Howle and Ms. Ronan are also paired in Dominic Cooke’s “On Chesil Beach,” which opens next week).

If Shakespeare tends to goad modern performers toward displays of shoulder-swinging actorishness, Chekhov often has a contrary, admirably humbling effect. His psychology is so acute, his language so supple and sharp, that his work calls forth low-key intelligence instead of high-toned magniloquence. The characters in “The Seagull” are vain, sometimes miserable creatures, but they are also aware of the comical aspects of their existence. There is gravity — even tragedy — in their circumstances, but nothing heavy about the play itself. It holds its shape like a perfect soufflé, rich and airy, simple and yet the product of miraculous technique.
