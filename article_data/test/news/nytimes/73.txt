Shooting of Agent Shines Light on a Federal Fight Against Chicago Gun Crime
WASHINGTON — At 3:18 a.m. last Friday, a federal agent undercover on a task force was quietly switching out a tracking device planted on a vehicle on a dark street on Chicago’s South Side.

It was a routine maneuver for the agent, who was less than a year out of the training academy of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He had been sent to Chicago as part of a Trump administration push to tackle the city’s gun crisis.

But with a burst of gunshots, that Friday morning turned catastrophic. The agent was shot in the head, then thrown into a car by a fellow agent and rushed to a hospital. “I’m coming in — just take me to the hospital,” the driving agent yelled over the police scanner. “Officer hit; we need escort to a hospital now!”

The shooting of the undercover agent, who is expected to fully recover, has drawn attention to the group he was assigned to, the Crime Gun Strike Force. Established by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June to combat gun trafficking and violence in Chicago, the task force is one of the most concrete examples of his efforts to fight gun violence. Twenty A.T.F. agents were assigned to it.
