Review: In ‘Life of the Party,’ Melissa McCarthy Goes to College
With one important exception — to be discussed in a moment — the students at Decatur University are a notably bland bunch. They have no political opinions or intellectual passions, their sex lives are almost nonexistent, and their parties rarely get out of hand. At Decatur, to be “Life of the Party” (which is the instantly forgettable title of this almost equally unmemorable campus comedy) is to clear a pretty low bar.

Still, since the title refers to Melissa McCarthy — a producer and co-writer (with her husband, Ben Falcone, who directed) — there is a measure of liveliness at least. Ms. McCarthy plays Deanna, who finds herself, somewhere in her 40s, suddenly divorced and enrolled at Decatur, where her daughter, Maddie (Molly Gordon), happens to be a senior. Deanna gave up her dreams of studying archaeology to raise Maddie and endure wedlock to a guy named Dan, played by Matt Walsh.

Mr. Walsh is one of several fine comic performers without much to do. (Julie Bowen, Stephen Root and Gillian Jacobs are among the others.) Only the great Maya Rudolph, as Deanna’s best friend, manages to spike the artificially sweetened lemonade mix she is handed. But everyone seems game and eager to please, and happy to be working with Ms. McCarthy.
