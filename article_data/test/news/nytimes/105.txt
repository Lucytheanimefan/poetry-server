For a Designer, Less Is More
“I found that to be a shabby-chic aesthetic,” Ms. Shah said. “I wanted something more finished looking. Exposed brick is an overpowering interior feature.”

She also feared it might attract bugs. “I feel like things can live in a wall like that — nobody wants to say that out loud.”

She moved on, and the place sold for $610,000. “The brick wall made it popular,” Mr. Lahav said.

A few blocks south, a sunny alcove studio at Gramercy Park Towers, circa 1964, had an asking price of $599,000. Maintenance was around $850 a month.

It, too, was in pristine condition. But Ms. Shah was wary of the location on busy Third Avenue, and found the building’s swooping marquee too theatrical.

“It was not the kind of ambience I imagined coming home to,” she said. “I wanted understated.”

The building also had a full-time doorman, as did many in the area. “I didn’t want all these people to greet when I came home,” Ms. Shah said. “It feels more hotel than home to me. Some people like all the service, but I wasn’t looking for that.”

Mr. Lahav showed her a small studio in another Gramercy building, for a temptingly low $465,000, with monthly maintenance of $800. It was smaller than most, he said, “but she actually liked it. She was not a typical buyer who is looking for square footage.”

She didn’t go for the Murphy bed, however, which seemed too labor-intensive for day-to-day living. “I didn’t want to do all these acrobatics to make it work,” she said.
