Foraging for Spring Scents, With a British Perfumer
Lyn Harris is in hot pursuit of lilacs. On a recent spring morning, the revered British perfumer makes her way through a sea of wild grass and cow parsley in an untamed quarter of London’s Regent’s Park. “It’s so idyllic,” she says of the springtime scene: In this quiet corner, the incessant hum of central London traffic is eclipsed — almost — by birdsong and bell chimes from St. Marylebone Church. “You’re in the middle of town, and yet it feels so wild.”

The first female classically trained nose in England, Harris can be seen walking like this and foraging for flora and fauna most mornings, as the park connects her Primrose Hill home to the Marylebone shop and laboratory of Perfumer H, the British boutique fragrance brand she founded in 2015. “I love that smell,” she says as she inhales a clutch of dandelion leaves plucked from the side of the path before adding them to her basket. “That greenness takes me right back to my childhood.”

Harris, who is originally from Halifax in West Yorkshire, spent long school holidays with her grandparents in the wilds of the Scottish countryside just outside Aberdeen. It was here that she acquired her creative affinity with seasonality — and the constant flux of nature still inspires and informs her scents. “The seasons are very much a part of how I create,” she says. She traded the north of England for Paris to study under the late perfumer Monique Schlienger in her early 20s, before heading to Grasse, the epicenter of scent, where she spent five years at the prestigious French fragrance manufacturer Robertet. She’s been working with the company as an independent ever since. “When I lived in the South of France I really missed the change of season — it renews your thought processes and reinvigorates everything in your life,” she says.

In 2000, along with her partner Christophe Michel, Harris established Miller Harris, the global perfume business that created the bespoke scent L’Air de Rien for Jane Birkin. After a brief hiatus, Harris decided she wanted a slower pace and launched the impeccably curated, small-scale scent brand that is Perfumer H. It’s a label that’s imbued with an incredibly personalized feel: Harris is often found serving customers on the shop floor with the scents she’s created.
