Opinion | I Am Not a Mother. But I Am Something.
My mother was visiting me a few years ago in Chicago for Mother’s Day and we decided to go to church before brunch. The church was big and grandiose, filled with people. At one point in the service, the pastor asked all the mothers in the congregation to stand. My mother stood up. One woman after another rose to her feet. It was a nice tribute, an acknowledgment of all the things mothers are and do.

I didn’t stand. I was in my mid-30s at the time and was not a mother (I still am not). After the service, an older man sitting nearby came up to me and said he’d noticed that I didn’t stand. “Is everything O.K.?” he asked.

I felt awkward, unsure of what to say. He said he’d pray for me.

He’d assumed something was wrong because I didn’t have children. Why? And why did he feel he could approach me, a total stranger, and ask about this very personal matter? A woman’s fertility, it seems, is still a subject of public concern. But the strangest thing about that short conversation was that I didn’t know how to tell him the truth — that I had been a kind of mother. I didn’t have the words.

I had been in a long-term relationship with a man who had two sons. We lived together, and since he shared custody of the boys with his ex-wife, we had them with us part of the time. It wasn’t simple. At first, I was unsure of how to adjust to having these young children — 4 and 6 years old — in my life. But over the nearly five years we spent together, our relationship changed.
