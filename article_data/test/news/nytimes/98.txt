Samantha Irby: By the Book
And what book would you most like to see turned into a movie or TV show?

“I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,” by Erika L. Sánchez, would be such a good movie. It’s about a very real girl dealing with real girl problems, craving independence and coping with anger and depression while grappling with boys and her parents and the death of her sister and all that. It’s sad and funny and hopeful, and it would be amazing on the big screen.

What’s the last book that made you cry?

I read a lot of Y.A. books, and I just finished this book “Being Fishkill,” by Ruth Lehrer, that made me ugly cry in a public place which was incredibly embarrassing!

The last book that made you laugh?

“Everything Is Awful,” by Matt Bellassai. That dude is so bent out of shape about so many things and so am I, because everything is horrible and embarrassing. I’m almost sure we are the same person. It was like reading my diary.

The last book that made you furious?

“The Girl on the Train.” I read it because everybody else read and loved it, plus I’m really into Emily Blunt, and halfway through the book I was like “WHAT.” Homegirl was infuriating! Literally why did she keep going back to that house?! Is this the kind of thing where Americans say we like something even though it’s terrible because we don’t want to look dumb because British people made it? I was rooting for her to die the entire time.

What kind of reader were you as a child?

Voracious. I had an old mom, who definitely was not a cool mom, who encouraged me to stay indoors and avoid human interaction, so I just read all the time. All of the Sweet Valley High and The Baby-Sitters Club books and every single unrequited teenage love story released between 1989 and 1995, when I discovered grunge and focused my sadness there instead.

Did you ever get in trouble for reading a book?

My mom once threw an R. L. Stine book in the trash because she thought it was demonic. It was a library book! I had to pay a fine!

Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?

Maybe this is my misandry showing, but boy did I love Amy from “Gone Girl.” I didn’t even really hate Nick, in fact I could identify with a lot of things going on in his life? But ultimately, when the twist came, I tented my witchy fingers and was like “HAHAHAHAHA YES. FINISH HIM.”
