A New 25-Story Tower on City Hall Park
For his firm’s first residential building in the United States, the London-based architect Richard Rogers began with a difficult, oddly proportioned site — a kite-shaped piece of land in the Financial District of Manhattan, right across from City Hall Park.

Mr. Rogers, who won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2007 and is best known for buildings with exposed structural members and systems, such as the Centre Pompidou in Paris (with Renzo Piano) and Lloyd’s of London, relished the challenge.

“I love constraints,” he said during a recent visit to New York. “One thing I hate is the idea of a white piece of paper,” where there are no problems to solve.
