Novartis and AT&T Spoke to Mueller’s Office About Payments to Michael Cohen
But many questions about their relationships with Mr. Cohen — and the services he provided — remain unanswered. A onetime personal-injury lawyer and a veteran of the New York City taxi business, Mr. Cohen has no background in the health care or telecommunications industries.

The Treasury Department’s inspector general said on Wednesday that it was investigating whether financial records related to Mr. Cohen had been “improperly disseminated.” A spokesman for the inspector general suggested that the inquiry would be complete later this month.

Stephen Ryan, a lawyer representing Mr. Cohen, declined to comment.

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating Mr. Cohen for possible bank fraud and election-law violations, among other matters, according to people briefed on the investigation.

In court papers filed on Wednesday, Mr. Cohen’s lawyers denied some of the claims in Mr. Avenatti’s report. But they openly acknowledged that Mr. Cohen had received payments from AT&T and Novartis, and that federal authorities had seized records related to the transactions when they raided Mr. Cohen’s office, apartment and hotel room last month.

Mr. Cohen reached out to Novartis executives in early 2017, presenting himself as knowledgeable about the president’s thinking on health care and other areas of concern to the company, according to a person briefed on the talks. The person would speak only under the condition of anonymity because the contract was private.

Novartis said that after it determined that Mr. Cohen could not provide the services he offered, the company wanted to terminate his contract. But the drug giant learned it could do so only for cause, so it allowed the contract to expire.

Joe Jimenez, the chief executive at Novartis at the time the deal was signed with Mr. Cohen, left the company in January. His replacement, Vasant Narasimhan, took over the next month, and the company has said he had no role in the arrangement. Mr. Narasimhan dined with Mr. Trump along with other European business leaders at this year’s World Economic Forum, but Novartis said his presence at the dinner had nothing to do with the payments to Mr. Cohen.
