The Cannes Film Festival Opens Amid Disruptions
To grasp the implications of this fight, you need to see that Cannes is very much France itself — economically, politically, culturally. Françoise Nyssen, the minister of culture, wrote in the official catalog, “This year, I would like to showcase a special cause: gender equality,” which will be difficult at a festival that fails to champion the work of women as much as it should. The board of directors of Cannes includes representatives from French organizations across the entertainment industry. Last year, one of these, the theatrical exhibitors guild FNCF, protested the festival's inclusion of the Netflix titles “Okja” and “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)” because it wouldn’t be releasing them in French theaters.

So, it’s complicated, which is why it is exasperating that the face-off between Cannes and Netflix is too often merely framed as evidence of French intransigence, of a fusty festival not being hip to the demands of the young audience. The system known as the French cultural exception works, at least for some in the industry. Right now, movies that open in France need to play in theaters 36 months before they start streaming. That might seem an outrageous eternity for on-demand appetites, but this rule is part of a European Union system that helps finance European movies and TV, bringing work to big and small screens.

Maybe the system needs to change or maybe Netflix does or maybe both. Whatever the case, worries about the dominance of the American entertainment industry have long been a refrain in France and elsewhere. While quotas, taxes and protective measures can seem well, foreign to some Americans, consider that last weekend “Avengers: Infinity War” was the top box-office draw everywhere from Australia to Ukraine. The people who benefit the most from this global domination are those on the board of the Walt Disney Company. Meanwhile, I am still thinking about “Donbass,” a harsh, mordant Ukrainian movie from Sergei Loznitsa that feels very Cannes.
