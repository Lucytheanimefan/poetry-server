N.Y.U. Promised Reforms in Abu Dhabi. Report Says It Has Reneged.
But N.Y.U. strongly challenged the report, saying that it was “neither right nor fair” and that its title — “Forced Labor at N.Y.U. Abu Dhabi” — was “both incorrect and inflammatory. More broadly, we disagree with the report’s findings, which are not based on primary evidence.”

The 129-page report resurrects a highly contentious chapter in the recent history of N.Y.U. and its ambitious agenda for academic globalization, featuring degree-granting campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, and 11 academic centers on five continents.

In 2014, The New York Times published an investigation into the plight of construction workers at the Abu Dhabi campus, documenting how many had been charged steep recruitment fees to get their jobs, how few were being paid what they had been promised, and how some lived in miserable conditions, all in contravention of standards N.Y.U. had set for the project. Those standards had been established because of concerns over the region’s reputation for mistreatment of its imported work force, with many coming from the Indian subcontinent and the Philippines.

The university, together with an Abu Dhabi government agency, then commissioned an international investigative firm, Nardello & Company, to review allegations of labor and compliance issues. After the firm found that about one-third of migrant construction workers had been excluded from the protections of N.Y.U.’s labor guidelines, the university took “full responsibility” for shortchanging some workers, and promised to repay them.

In its new report, the labor coalition noted that N.Y.U. had paid 6,600 of the 10,000 workers subject to wage theft, but had not been able to locate the others. Still, the coalition contended that N.Y.U. had not done enough to reimburse workers for the recruitment fees they had to pay initially, even though multinational companies like Apple, and the general contractors preparing for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, have paid workers millions of dollars for “comparable recruitment costs and fees.”
