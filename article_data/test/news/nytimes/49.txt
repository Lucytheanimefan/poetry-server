Opinion | Trump and the Mosquito Wars
In Ohio, Republicans picked congressman and former lobbyist Jim Renacci to run against Senator Sherrod Brown. “Washington is broken. I’ve seen it firsthand,” he twittered with a #DrainTheSwamp hashtag. Only that mosquito, you see, knows where the malaria comes from.

The primary was billed as Renacci versus a Wealthy Businessmen, but the congressman himself has assets worth at least $34 million. (Hard to know what counts as rich these days. We used to refer to a well-heeled politician as a “millionaire,” but now, being a millionaire member of Congress is average. We need a new marker. Ten million? A hundred? A billion? Discuss among yourselves and send me your vote.)

Meanwhile in Indiana, Wealthy Businessman Mike Braun won the right to run against endangered Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly. Braun was running against two members of the House, both graduates of Wabash College with problematic driving records and an attachment to the president so intense, one was campaigning to get him a Nobel Prize.

(Adoration of Donald Trump was a theme in the Republican contests even more intense than cleaning up Washington. Nobody seemed to feel it was possible that, by this point, the swamp is Trump.)

Braun campaigned on the fact that nobody could tell the two congressmen apart. He came to debates in shirt sleeves while his opponents wore what appeared to be the exact same suit. There are two possible lessons here. One is that if the shirt-sleeve idea catches on, sooner or later there’s going to be a candidate desperate enough to show up in pajamas.

The other is that if you are a congressman running against another congressman, do something to set yourself apart. Shave your head, or walk across the state barefoot with your pet beagle, Hoosier.

And one more thing about Indiana: Mike Pence’s older brother Greg won a congressional nomination! For the extremely safe seat that used to be Mike’s until he became governor. Even though he was stupendously well known without any serious opposition, Greg Pence spent about $1 million on the effort while avoiding debates and interviews.

Don’t worry, this isn’t another Wealthy Businessman story. Pence actually seems to have been a terrible businessman, having bankrupted the family convenience store empire earlier in his career, before he rebounded as the owner of two “antique malls.”
