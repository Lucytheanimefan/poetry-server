‘We Do Not Need You’

Eric Schneiderman, New York’s former attorney general, may have been a longtime champion of women’s rights, but he now stands accused of beating and verbally abusing multiple women. After hearing the accusations against him, Samantha Bee said that she didn’t feel at all conflicted about condemning the onetime liberal darling.

“Now, Schneiderman was a guest on my show, so this is a little complicated for me to talk about, but — just kidding, it’s not complicated.” — SAMANTHA BEE

Schneiderman’s willingness to take on domestic abusers in the political sphere didn’t make Bee any less ready to bid him good riddance.

“Eric Schneiderman, you are trash and we do not need you. Tarana Burke started the #MeToo movement 11 years ago on Myspace. It will keep moving forward without you just fine.” — SAMANTHA BEE
