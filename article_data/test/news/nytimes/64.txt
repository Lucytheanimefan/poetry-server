In Washington, a Brighter Spotlight on Technology
How is tech etiquette different in Washington than elsewhere?

I feel like everyone is hunched over their phones in Washington, even more than other places. This is a news-obsessed town that is texting and emailing at all hours.

There seems to be a bit of a generational divide on use of communications apps. Younger staffers on Capitol Hill often use encrypted apps and direct messages on Twitter.

But even some of my older sources (my peers, really) can sometimes text me at all hours. It feels totally appropriate to call, text, or Signal late at night or during weekends. Many an interview is done with children heard in the background at a park.

Outside of work, what tech product do you and your family currently love using?

My family is trying hard to not obsess about tech. We spend way too much time on our own screens. But we did get an Amazon Echo speaker and so far, I’m actually underwhelmed. I thought it would rock my world but it’s just marginally more convenient and helpful.

Are you actively trying to get your kids to reduce their tech usage?

I just wish it was easier for my kids to unplug. YouTube, texting, and Facebook are just so compelling. I have rules and parental controls on their apps but the lure is strong.
