Justin Peck Is Making Ballet That Speaks to Our Everyday Lives
Several of Peck’s collaborators spoke of his idiosyncratic way of hearing music, and the density of steps that it generates. Sufjan Stevens, the indie musician who has written scores for several of Peck’s ballets, explained Peck’s gift for giving music what he called “consciousness and mass.” “I often perceive music as linear, with a beginning, middle and end,” he wrote in an email. “But Justin’s work often has a depth perception along the Z-axis that is nonlinear. It’s more like how you would describe ‘volume.’ It’s expansive.” Craig Hall, a former N.Y.C.B. soloist who is Peck’s “ballet master” (essentially, the keeper and teacher of his work for the company), told me how Peck discovers a different path through music. “He tries to find the softer notes laid a little bit under the dominant ones, and he accents that with the movement. All of a sudden, it makes the music more detailed and more vibrant,” Hall said. “For everyone else it’s like, ‘I’m going down Broadway,’ but he’s going down some side street, and he’s discovered some little cafe along the way.”

I first met Peck in November at a rehearsal studio in the Flatiron district, where he was making tweaks to the choreographic centerpiece of “Carousel”: “Blow High, Blow Low,” a fast-paced number for a group of 11 men. He’d been working on it for nearly two years. Led by Ramasar, it is eight minutes of continuous movement in which a group of sailors attempt to persuade the show’s main character, Billy Bigelow, a perpetual outsider, to join them at sea.

In the dance, the men engage in rituals of giddy masculine camaraderie: They embrace one another, throw one another, ride on one another’s shoulders and dance in heated unison. Familiar gestures, like scanning the horizon or clenching a fist in a show of braggadocio, are repeated and enlarged as the dancers progress from a state of communal glee at the prospect of setting out for the open seas to actually becoming the sea itself, their bodies forming wave crests, the mast of a ship, flocks of gulls diving in the wind. At one point, the music cuts out, and all you can hear are feet tapping out rhythms, the thumps of dancing bodies when they land jumps, and the steady piping of breath, keeping time. It’s a moment that allows everyone in the room to share in the pleasure of the dancers’ vigor and exertion. After half an hour of rehearsal, they were soaked and smiling.

When Peck and I sat down afterward to talk, it was hard to square the dancing I’d just seen — forceful almost to the point of fearsomeness, with a quality of rough joy — with the person in front of me. Onstage, Peck is a matinee idol, with large, dark eyes, creamy skin and the mysterious expression of someone consorting with his own thoughts, but in person he is mellow and grounded. He speaks quietly and a bit reluctantly, tending to avert his eyes after a few sentences: a symptom of his thoughtfulness but also, perhaps, of a persistent shyness left over from childhood. I was surprised, given the scale of his ambition and how easily he seemed to command the rehearsal room, that he began our conversation by speaking about his insecurities as a dancer.

As a young man, he told me, he was keenly aware of ballet’s tormenting unattainability, the sense that “there’s a perfect standard or an ideal, and you know that you can’t ever be part of it — like there’s always going to be something wrong with your dancing or your performance.” The beauty of ballet comes from training the body to conform to ideal geometries, cultivating limbs that make strong, straight lines. If you begin training at a young enough age, your shape can be molded, somewhat, to the dance’s demands, but Peck came to ballet at the relatively late age of 14, and he never felt at home in balletic movement.

This didn’t keep him from being intensely drawn to it. When he was 15, newly arrived at the School of American Ballet, which is housed at Lincoln Center and is a feeder school for the N.Y.C.B., he would go to see the company perform each night. He had come to New York from San Diego, where the dance community was tiny and the opportunities for seeing classical ballet scarce. The S.A.B. students were given free tickets to most performances, which usually juxtaposed three or four works of different lengths and styles. (In a given season, the company might perform up to 40 works, a combination of new commissions and classics by Balanchine and Robbins.) He would sit in different seats each night, sometimes in the upper tiers so he could study Balanchine’s large-scale dances (“Symphony in C,” “Serenade”) from a bird’s-eye view. He internalized Balanchine’s fast footwork, his precise musicality, the way that he could generate seemingly infinite shapes from the rearrangement of bodies onstage. From Jerome Robbins’s work, he learned about storytelling, the ways Robbins used interpersonal dynamics among the dancers to create tension and drama.
