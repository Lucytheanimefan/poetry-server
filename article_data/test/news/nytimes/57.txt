Opinion | What It Would Mean to End the Korean War
WASHINGTON — No, the Korean War still is not over. While an armistice in 1953 ended active fighting, it was never followed by a peace treaty. This is why during their recent meeting, Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, in addition to jointly calling for the “complete denuclearization” of the Korean Peninsula, also pledged to formally conclude the war.

Much ambiguity remains about what exactly it would take to accomplish what Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon vowed to do, and many analysts have expressed skepticism about this diplomatic overture, pointing to a number of other supposed breakthroughs in the past that petered out. Yet this moment does seem different in at least one important respect.

The two leaders’ joint declaration last month contained another significant clause that went relatively unnoticed: “South and North Korea affirmed the principle of determining the destiny of the Korean nation on their own accord.” The statement is not entirely novel; there was another one like it in a 2000 joint declaration. But it underscores the fact that as much as rapprochement between the Koreas concerns other parties to the Korean War, like the United States and China — and, given the wider security implications, the rest of the world as well — it is a matter principally between the two of them.

This point would go without saying were it not for this war’s curious history, which again and again relegated both Koreas to the rank of extras as they were upstaged by their Cold War patrons. American government officials should remember this overlooked truth as they prepare President Trump for his own meeting with Mr. Kim in the coming weeks — and perhaps all the more because the North Korean government is making direct gestures toward the United States, as on Wednesday when it pledged to release three American prisoners.
