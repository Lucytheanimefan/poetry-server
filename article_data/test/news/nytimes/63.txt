Jerome Robbins, the Experimentalist
In “Les Noces,” Robbins follows quite closely the scenario of Stravinsky’s 1923 dance cantata. “Noces” means “wedding,” and this marriage is an arranged one. After centuries of ballets and other works about happy-ever-after nuptials, here is a work in which bride and groom are the least willing people onstage. At the end, while solemn bells sound, everyone else bends as if having completed their mission, but the central couple are locked together in imagery that suggests their sexual union is harsh and involuntary. The bride, holding a shape as if in mid-jump, seems a cousin of the Chosen Maiden in “The Rite of Spring,” tragically fulfilling the collective will.

Few Stravinsky scores are more incisive or thrilling: This is scored for four solo singers, a choir (Musica Sacra in the current performances), four pianos and percussion. Its premiere occurred in France; Stravinsky approved both Russian and French versions of the sung (sometimes shouted) texts. Since the fashion is now for Russian — and since few understand Stravinsky’s partly archaic words — I wish supertitles were employed.

Robbins’s ballet is good but suffers by comparison to the superlative 1923 choreography by Bronislava Nijinska, which, with greater force, makes bride and groom yet more passive and the social units far more shatteringly machine-like. (It remains in repertory with the Royal Ballet. There have been scattered American revivals in recent decades.)

Still, Robbins’s ending is all his own and reveals his compassion. You sometimes hear claims that Robbins’s work is misogynist. Though he occasionally shows women behaving badly (and men, too, as in “Fancy Free”), I disagree. The heroines of “Noces,” “Dybbuk,” “Goldberg” and many other Robbins ballets aren’t exalted or glorified; they express a particular sympathy on his part. He didn’t sublimate; he showed how things are for humans in this world.
