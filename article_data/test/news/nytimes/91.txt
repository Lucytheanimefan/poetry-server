‘The Americans’ Season 6, Episode 7 Recap: Stan Picks the Lock
How can you not be on Team Elizabeth? Philip may seem more interesting. She is more interesting.

Then came Elizabeth’s meticulously planned but dicey extraction attempt, which worked well until it didn’t. Philip, driving a shuttle bus, and Hank, driving a truck, boxed in Harvest’s car. (The sleeper agent’s real name was Dan Murton, if you’re keeping score.) Norm stopped traffic. Elizabeth got the startled Harvest out of his car and into the bus; a day laborer Philip had hired switched places with Harvest. (Question: Wasn’t the use of a civilian who was likely to be questioned by the F.B.I. a glaring problem with the plan?)

It went like clockwork, but the F.B.I. agent who lost the tail turned out to be well trained — with the kind of observational skill Elizabeth has drilled into Paige, he quickly reported descriptions of every vehicle that had been near Harvest’s car. Elizabeth, Philip and Harvest ditched the bus and got into a van driven by Marilyn, but not quickly enough. A pair of F.B.I. agents blocked the street and in the ensuing gunfight they were both shot, while Marilyn took a bullet in the forehead and Harvest took one in the gut. (The entire sequence echoed the final episode of Season 1, when Philip first rode to Elizabeth’s rescue, speeding in reverse though an F.B.I. roadblock while Elizabeth was shot in the stomach by Stan. That was another occasion when the couple were reconciled through physical danger, and it was also the one time so far that Stan had witnessed Philip and Elizabeth in action.)

Harvest, played by Jonathan Kells Phillips, turned out to be a heck of an agent — not only did he take out the two G-men with a handgun from a moving van, he recited a long list of messages to Philip, between hideous groans, while he lay dying from his wound. One message was practical — the radiation sensor schematics were at an air base in France — and two were personal, “I love you” to his mother and “I hope you die the miserable death you deserve” to his father. Philip was impressed, all around.

Things got even more difficult, for the spies and for the viewer, when Elizabeth and Philip pulled into a garage to switch vehicles again and Philip spotted a fire ax on the wall. In the ultimate proof of his loyalty to his wife and to the cause, he chopped off Marilyn’s hands and head, which Elizabeth wrapped in old clothes and packed (for later disposal in a nearby body of water). In a change of pace from the episode’s scene-ending close-ups, the last shot was of Marilyn’s headless, handless body on the garage floor.

Elizabeth and Philip: reunited and it feels so, not bad, exactly, but complicated. Philip had gone a long way toward redeeming himself in Elizabeth’s eyes, but they’ll never get back to those simple Season 1 days.

On the flight to Washington, Philip stared at Elizabeth as she sketched the airplane window. “Someone’s making me learn,” she said, embarrassed. At home, Philip made a guilt call to Henry and Elizabeth headed right back to work (at the Haskards’), unsure when she’d be home. First, though, they had a moment, with Elizabeth stroking Philip’s jaw and touching his chest. Before wordlessly leaving.
