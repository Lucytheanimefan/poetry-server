THURSDAY PUZZLE — Those of you who have ever been in the vicinity of children know that they demand a lot of attention. Even activities that are seemingly child-adjacent — cooking, laundry, stepping on Legos in the middle of the night — require a lot of time and, in the case of the Legos, possible medical attention.

That’s why I was so impressed with the crossword debut of Caitlin Reid, who is the stay-at-home mother of four children. As someone who also made her debut in The New York Times crossword puzzle while at home with my children, I can relate to a person who seeks out something for herself, in this case a creative outlet that doesn’t involve Pokémon or Elmo.

So welcome, Ms. Reid. And you will sleep again. One day.

Tricky Clues

11A: I knew that “Take flight?” was LAM just because I’ve seen it before, but it feels odd to me. Do people LAM? Or do they go on the LAM?

16A: Tricky! Were you thinking about a temple where one goes to worship? Not today. “Something found near a temple” in this puzzle is an EAR, which is near the temple on the side of one’s head.
