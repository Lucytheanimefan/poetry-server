Art Shay, Whose Camera Captured the Famous and the Everyday, Dies at 96
Art Shay, a noted photographer who chronicled the famous and powerful, including nine presidents, as well as the everyday life of mid-20th-century Americans, died on April 28 at his home in Deerfield, Ill. He was 96.

The cause was heart failure, his son Richard said.

In more than 1,500 assignments for Life, Time, Look, Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines, Mr. Shay photographed famous Americans like Marlon Brando, Elizabeth Taylor, Muhammad Ali, Jimmy Hoffa, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and President John F. Kennedy. He also passionately documented the streets of his adopted hometown, Chicago.
