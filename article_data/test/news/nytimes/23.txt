‘Painted in Mexico’: When a New Art Flourished Far From Mother Spain
The great cathedral of Mexico City is a visual opera of light, movement and sacred history. And at its center is a true coup de théâtre: the carved and painted “Retablo de los Reyes” — “Altar of the Kings” — by the 18th-century artist Juan Rodríguez Juárez. At once soaring and torrential, the altar insists on your smallness, your next-to-nothingness in the redemptive drama. At the same time, by overwhelming and engulfing you it makes you part of the story. You’re both audience and participant, a vital particle.

That’s how art as spiritual theater works. As with all theater, you need to be physically present for the full effect. To experience Rodríguez Juárez’s immovable altar, you have to go there. But sometimes theater will come to you, as it does in many of the 130 pictures, large and small, that make up “Painted in Mexico, 1700-1790: Pinxit Mexici” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Along with making emotional demands, the show puts you on unfamiliar historical ground. Only within the past few decades has Spanish colonial art, now usually referred to as Spanish American or Viceregal art, been awarded anything like center-stage status in North American museums. The last major survey in New York City was the Brooklyn Museum’s “Converging Cultures: Art & Identity in Spanish America” in 1996, a display of paintings, furniture and textiles — much of it long in storage — culled from the permanent collection. That show traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which, more than two decades later, in collaboration with Fomento Cultural Banamex, A.C., in Mexico City, organized the show now at the Met.

There have been other exhibitions between 1996 and the present, but few and far between on the scale this soul-stirring art deserves. Institutionally, the attitude seems to have been that Spanish American art was problematic, not quite good enough to be high art, but not low enough to qualify as ”folk.” Much of it was assumed to be derivative of the old master European work deemed the proper subject for exhibition.

But over time, gradually, some attention began to be paid. Museums were feeling pressure to expand their demographics. Young art historians were looking for untapped material. And thanks to multiculturalism, hybridity, as a political concept, became cool. So people began to look at Spanish American art and see it for what it is: deeply fabulous, as the Met exhibition confirms.

A lot of what’s here is religious, and specifically Roman Catholic, though you don’t have to be a believer to respond to a picture like the “Apotheosis of the Eucharist” of 1723, another Rodríguez Juárez tour de force which, like an organ chord, opens the show. Commissioned for the convent of Corpus Christi in Mexico City, the work’s inspiration was as much political as devotional. (The convent was founded for Indian women of noble birth, at a time when “noble” and “Indian” were mutually exclusive concepts in much of Europe.) But what matters about it now — and surely did when it was new — is its visionary imagery: its swirling clouds, its rapturous saints, the angel-borne host that beams like a high-power flashlight.

No question, that this artist and Mexican-born contemporaries like Miguel Cabrera and José de Ibarra, kept a close eye, through imported prints, on art trends in Europe. But by 1700 Mexico, also called New Spain, had its own fully developed art industry, replete with guilds and academies, family dynasties and professional rivalries. And it had an international reputation. Shipments of fresh-from-the-easel pictures were regularly leaving the New World for Spain, many carrying the phrase “Pinxit Mexici” — “Painted in Mexico” — as a gauge of value and a point of pride.
