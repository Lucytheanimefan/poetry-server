When Should You List Your Home?
It is finally spring, and yes, that is the best time to sell your home. But if you want the quickest and biggest return, the exact time you should list your home varies depending on where you live, according to Zillow.

Generally speaking, if you list your home around the beginning of May you can expect to get a higher price (by about $2,400 on average) and have a quicker sale (about two weeks faster) than you would if you put your home on the market at any other time of year, Zillow found.
