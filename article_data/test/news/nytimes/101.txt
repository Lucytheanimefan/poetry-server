Thai Dishes That Pave a Chef’s Path Home in Elmhurst, Queens
The food draws from Ms. Moonroj’s upbringing in Lampang in northern Thailand: coins of sai ua, pork sausage made in-house with a crunchy riddle of pig’s ear; frilly hearts of red cotton flowers in a heady stew of pork ribs, ground pork and pork blood, both loose and set in spongy cubes, a kind of mineral-tinged tofu; and red ant eggs resembling swollen grains of rice, clinging to strands of shredded mango alongside anchovies crisped in sesame oil until they become fossils of themselves.

Young jackfruit, not yet sweet, is boiled and pounded in a mortar until it gives. It’s flung in a pan with ground pork belly and emerges almost as meaty in texture. But the flavor is all herbs, half registered as fragrance — galangal and sun-baked earth, bright threads of kaffir lime leaves, and cilantro roots, subtler and more profound than the stems.

Nam prik ong comes in a small bowl — too small, you think, until you taste it. Although flanked by blades of romaine and pork skins like ossified fluff, it defies the word “dip”: It’s a swirl of ground pork, as thick as ragù, with an undersea punch of shrimp paste and fermented soybeans. Thai bird chiles are out in force. For a moment, no other dish exists.

Ms. Moonroj makes larb neua from a recipe of her mother’s, with ground pork belly and liver, a play of fat and cream. Unlike larb in southern Thailand, it abstains from sourness and rice powder, instead relying on herbs and spices, each toasted separately to coax out its fragrance, then left to quietly become one with the pork for an hour before cooking.

The heat breaks late and lasts. For a few long minutes, it may take over the mouth entirely; other dishes must wait. The source: A smoke-haunted paste of dried chiles, long pepper — stronger than black pepper, more expansive and musky-sweet — and makhwaen seeds, kin to Sichuan peppercorn, for a faint kiss of lemon before your mouth goes numb.
