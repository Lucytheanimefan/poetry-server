Is Africa becoming a renewables superpower?
Photos: The clean energy giants powering Africa Noor Complex Solar Power Plant, Morocco – The world's largest concentrated solar power (CSP) plant, called the Noor Complex, is being built in the Moroccan desert. Noor 1, the first phase of three, is located near the town of Ouarzazate on the edge of the Sahara.



It was switched on in February, 2016, and provides 160 megawatts of the project's planned 580 megawatt capacity. It's set to be completed by the end of 2018. The project is expected to provide electricity for over 1 million people. Hide Caption 1 of 13
