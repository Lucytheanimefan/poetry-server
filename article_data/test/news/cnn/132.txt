Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence drew a direct parallel between Donald Trump and former President Ronald Reagan in a speech Tuesday, painting the party's presumptive nominee as the rightful political descendant of the Gipper.

"Trust me when I say this, when we come together as a party and a people, when we elect strong majorities in the House and Senate and elect this good man as the 45th president of the United States, I know in my heart of hearts we will make America great again, at home and abroad," Pence said at an afternoon speech before the American Conservative Union Foundation's luncheon in Cleveland. "He's a builder. He's a fighter. He's a father, and he's a patriot."

"I have to tell you, having had some time to spend with this man and his family, I know that Donald Trump will be a great president of the United States of America because his heart beats with the heart of the American people," Pence continued. "I honestly believe, I honestly believe in the collective wisdom of the American people and the capacity of the people of our nation to know who we need, who the right person is at the right time for America."

The country was at a similar place in 1980, the governor of Indiana said, when Reagan was chosen as the GOP nominee. Comparing Trump to Reagan, Pence remarked that like Reagan, the Manhattan businessman "achieved great heights in his own career" but "never lost touch with everyday Americans."

"To be around our nominee, as I had the privilege to be, not only the campaign trail, but out among his associates, people that he's employed for years, and among his family," Pence said. "I have a sense of this man. I have a sense of his heart. I have a sense of his hands-on style of leadership, and for all the world, he reminds me of Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan achieved great things in his life and his career, a movie star, a celebrity, governor of the great state of California, but he never lost the common touch, did he?"

Pence recalled meeting President Reagan at the White House in 1988, "when I was preparing to lose my first campaign for Congress," he said.

"I sat down across from the president, for all the world, I felt like I was talking to Mount Rushmore," Pence said of his face-to-face encounter with the commander in chief.

Confessing "I was a little nervous," Pence said the president "graciously asked as the cameras were clicking" about how his campaign was going.

"And I said, well, it's going fine, but I got something I'd like to say," Pence continued. "He said, 'well, say it.'

"I said, 'Mr. President, I would just like to thank you for everything you've done for this country, and everything you've done to encourage my generation of Americans to believe in this country again.' And for all the world for the rest of my life, I will believe in that moment that the 40th president of the United States of America blushed, and said, 'well, that's a very nice thing of you to say,'" Pence said, delivering an impression of Reagan, to laughter and applause. "Like he'd never heard it before."

Remarking upon Reagan's "unshakable faith in the capacity of the American people to achieve greatness and astound the world," Pence declared of Trump, "I promise you, I hear it and I see it in the man who I believe will be the next president of the United States."

"He loves this country. He believes in the American people. And their boundless potential. He is unintimidated by the world," Pence said. "But he is in awe of the people of this country and I know that I know that I know, if we will work every day between now and six months from tomorrow, that on that day, Donald Trump will raise his hand, become the 45th president of the United States of America and he, and we, will make America great again."
