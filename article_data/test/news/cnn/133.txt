Mike Pence: Trump's 'vision, energy, and can-do spirit is reminiscent of President Teddy Roosevelt'
While touring the Panama Canal on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence compared his boss to the man behind the creation of the canal, former President Theodore Roosevelt.

"In President Donald Trump, I think the United States once again has a president whose vision, energy, and can-do spirit is reminiscent of President Teddy Roosevelt," Pence said during remarks at the expanded Panama Canal on Thursday. "Just as President Roosevelt exhorted his fellow Americans to ‘dare to be great,' President Donald Trump has dared our nation to ‘make America great again,' and we'll do it with all of our friends in the world."

"Then, as now, we have a builder of boundless optimism, who seeks to usher in a new era of shared prosperity all across this new world. Then, as now, we have a leader who sees things not just as they are, but for what they could be. And then, as now, we have a president who understands, in his words, 'A nation is only living as long as it is striving,'" Pence added.

Pence has called Roosevelt, the cousin to Franklin D. Roosevelt, one of his personal heroes.

Pence, on a nearly week-long trip through Central and South America, touted the Panama Canal as an engineering feat that "changed the face of the Earth." The canal recently expanded its Cocoli Locks.

"Under President Trump, the United States will break new ground and break new records," Pence said. "We'll recapture the spirit and rekindle the vision of our forebears in partnership with the free nations and free peoples across this hemisphere. We will once again awe the world with all that we accomplish together."

Pence is returning to the U.S. a day ahead of his scheduled return in order to meet with Trump at Camp David on Friday.
