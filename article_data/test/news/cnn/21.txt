Murder Of 16-Year-Old Marks Baltimore’s 100th Homicide This Year
BALTIMORE (WJZ) — Two teenagers have been shot to death on Baltimore’s streets–the latest a 16-year-old boy–as the city surpasses 100 murders for the first time this year.

The 16-year-old, who friends told WJZ Investigator Mike Hellgren went by Streetz or Jordan, was shot near a basketball court at the Mary Rodman Recreation Center in the southwest part of the city Tuesday around 8:20 p.m.

They plan a candlelight vigil Monday night at New Era Academy in Cherry Hill where he once attended classes.

“It’s sad,” said Kim Humphries, whose young son attends Rodman Elementary adjacent to the murder scene. “The victims keep getting younger and younger. I just feel for his family.”

Police Commissioner Darryl De Sousa called the violence “unacceptable.” He said the teen was also armed “with a .380” in his pocket and “known to police.” Police also said the teen had drugs on him.

“He’s not a number to us. He’s someone who had a family… Not just his life is lost, but everybody is destroyed behind this,” De Sousa said.

Mayor Catherine Pugh reacted to the murder this morning. “This was not just somebody playing on the basketball court. But let me just say this to you all: No child, no child, no death in this city is acceptable, and we’ve got to get guns out of the hands of our children and we’ve got to get guns out of the hands of those who are carrying illegal guns on our streets,” the mayor said.

Asked how do you get rid of the guns, Pugh replied, “Stop making them.”

Hellgren spoke to a neighbor who says he heard five gunshots. His fiance spotted the shooter running from a cement area at the back side of the rec center.

Police have yet to make any arrests in that case or the killing of 17-year-old Ray Glasgow III on Saturday near the Perkins Homes on Eden Street.

Glasgow was a standout City College High School athlete–the captain of his lacrosse team.

“It’s just so tragic. He had a bright future,” said his elementary school principal Rhonda Richetta.

Glasgow will be buried this week. The viewing at Baltimore’s Vaughn Greene Funeral Home is set for Friday from 4 p.m. until 8 p.m.

Police say he was not the shooter’s target and are looking for a white Nissan Altima coupe in connection to the murder.

Anyone with information on these unsolved murders can call Metro Crime Stoppers at 1-866-7-LOCKUP.

Although it is rare for Baltimore to hit 100 homicides this early in the year, last year the city hit the grim milestone on April 24th.
