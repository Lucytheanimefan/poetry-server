Major League Baseball's summer trade season is inching ever closer. When it arrives, pretty much everyone will be active in some capacity.

So let's go ahead and imagine a few swaps.

Ahead are suggestions for trade fixes for all 30 MLB teams. For contenders, this involves identifying players who could either patch weaknesses or elevate strengths. For noncontenders, it involves identifying players who should be moved for young talent that will be of future use.

There are individual players who fit well on more than one team, so there will be a few repeats along the way. Otherwise, the only thing left to know is we'll go in alphabetical order by city.
