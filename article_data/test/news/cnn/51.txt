Russian President Vladimir Putin registered five goals in an exhibition game in Russia on Thursday, the Associated Press reported.

Putin's "Legends of Hockey" team, which included former NHL veterans Pavel Bure and Slava Fetisov, earned a 12-7 victory. The AP noted, however, Putin's goal tally represented a step backward after he had eight goals in 2015 and seven in last year's contest.

Russian government network RT shared highlights from the game:

Putin praised his opponents on the night, a group of amateur-league players he called a "wonderful example" for the Russian people, per the AP.

While Putin's individual scoring total was down, he at least spared himself the embarrassment of taking a tumble on the ice, which happened in 2017.
