Buildings across England considered post-modern in design including a Slough trading estate have been given listed status.

The 17 structures, which also include houses and schools, have been added to the National Heritage List for England.

A crown court in Cornwall and housing schemes in London's Docklands are also on the list.

Post-modern architecture emerged in the 1970s in reaction to modernism but fell out of favour before a revival in 2011.

Commercial buildings recognised

Slough's McKay Trading Estate has been Grade II listed.

Patience Trevor, Historic England's Senior Listings Adviser said: "Rather than the functional, modernist box you might expect... it's a very elegant and distinctive building. It's dignified, but strong and robust at the same time".

Last year, a survey found Slough was the best place to work and live.

Also Grade II listed is a business park near Bristol, that is "injected with glamour" and "features circular forecourts following the turning circle of a car".

Categories of listed buildings

The system used for listing buildings in England was introduced just over 70 years ago.

A building is listed when it is of special architectural or historic interest considered to be of national importance and therefore worth protecting.

Grade I buildings are of exceptional interest, with 2.5% in this category.

Grade II* buildings are important buildings of more than special interest and account for 5.8% of listed buildings.

Grade II buildings are of special interest; 91.7% of listed buildings are in this class - the most likely grade for domestic buildings.

Today there are around 400,000 structures listed - from windmills, pigsties, piers and one rocket.

A building's listed status means there will be extra control over what changes can be made to its interior and exterior, which is different for each one that makes the list.
