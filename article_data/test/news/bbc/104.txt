I walk the line: How Richard Long turns epic journeys into art
A work he made at art school, A Line Made by Walking, sums up his attitude to art, and nature. It’s exactly as it sounds. He found a meadow and walked up and down, in a straight line, and took a photograph of the faint line he’d left behind.

The photo wasn’t the artwork. Nor was the line he’d made, which wouldn’t last. The artwork was the walking.

It was a good photo but it wasn’t a great photo. The photo wasn’t the artwork. Nor was the line he’d made, which wouldn’t last. The artwork was the walking. This was a landmark in conceptual art.

"I’m not there just to take photographs," he explains. "I like to move stones around, carry stones in my pocket, make circles, make lines..."

Within a year of leaving college, Long had solo shows in Paris, Milan, New York and Düsseldorf ("I had to leave England to find the art world that was interested in my work"). Since then he’s had one man shows in the world’s greatest galleries (the Pompidou, the Guggenheim, MoMA, The Tate…) but his work is so pure and simple, neither money nor fame can spoil it.

He’s been doing the same thing for fifty years – making lines by walking, leaving a few traces along the way. He speaks to the child in all of us, collecting shells and pebbles, building sandcastles on the beach.

His art doesn’t try to dominate the landscape. It’s not weighed down by pride or vanity. "There’s lots of works that you don’t know about because I haven’t chosen to show you," he laughs. "In all my work you’re just seeing the tip of the iceberg."

Some of his sculptures are in such remote places that nobody will ever see them. A lot of his other sculptures will simply fade away. "If I’m on a walk that’s taken me near an old work I might go and check it out. Quite often, they’ve completely disappeared."
