As well as having four UK top 10 singles in the past 12 months, Rita Ora has appeared in the Fifty Shades films and has had lucrative deals with Adidas, lingerie firm Tezenis, Rimmel, DKNY and Marks & Spencer.

Robert Watts, who compiles the Sunday Times Rich List, said: "For years our music millionaires list has been dominated by older acts, such as the Rolling Stones and Sir Elton John, who have an older audiences able to pay a premium to see their favourite acts.

"But some of the biggest risers over the past year have been amongst younger acts such as Ed Sheeran, Adele and Calvin Harris.

"Streaming services, the internet and income from endorsements are helping today's young musicians build an international following - and with it their fortunes - far quicker than the older rockers."
