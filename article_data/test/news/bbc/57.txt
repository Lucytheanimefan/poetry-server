The One Show NHS Patients Unsung Hero Award Online Vote
We’re giving you the opportunity to vote for your NHS Unsung Hero. Viewers have been sending in their nominations for the army of support staff who keep the NHS running but don’t always get noticed, from porters and receptionists to drivers and lab workers, whether they are NHS Employees or volunteers who give up their time for free. From the hundreds of nominations, our esteemed panel of judges have selected three outstanding individuals, each of whom have gone way beyond the call of duty to really make a difference. Now it’s over to you. Have a look at all three of the nominees below and select who you’d like to vote for and then register and vote on the right hand side of the page. The vote will close and we’ll find out who your NHS Unsung Hero is during our special live show at 7pm on 11th May.
