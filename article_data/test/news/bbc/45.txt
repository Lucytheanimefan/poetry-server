When Britain's Anthony Joshua fought Wladimir Klitschko in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley in 2017, it turned out to be the sporting event of the year. First Joshua knocked the former champion down, then he too was punched to the canvas in a fight that was more dramatic than a Rocky movie. After looking destined for defeat, Joshua produced an astonishing comeback to beat the Ukrainian in an epic 11th round.

Now the two fighters will meet for the first time since that dramatic night last April. And in a brilliant new encounter they describe what really happened in the ring that night.
