Techniques : How to make mayonnaise using a food processor
Start by separating two eggs, put the egg yolks in a food processor or blender. Add one teaspoon of mustard and one teaspoon of white wine vinegar to the food processor. Blend until all of the ingredients combine.

Then with the machine going, slowly add rapeseed oil, as the mayonnaise gets thicker you can add the oil a little bit faster. Keep adding oil until you have reached the desired consistency, then season with salt and pepper.
