See how three tweaks can transform a quesadilla

There is arguably nothing that satisfies more simply and universally than cheese melted on toasted bread, which is why there are countless variations on that theme across cultures. The accompanying recipe borrows from one of those: the Mexican quesadilla, where, of course, tortillas are the “bread.”

Consider this a quick, healthfully balanced meal with intercontinental flair. The wealth of vegetables here make all the difference for flavor and nutrition, with a bounty of meaty mushrooms sliced and sauteed with onion until they are nicely browned, and a heap of fresh spinach, cooked until just wilted. They are seasoned with garlic, smoky Spanish paprika and a splash of sherry vinegar, and piled onto whole-grain flour tortillas that have been smeared generously with soft goat cheese (which is lower in calories and saturated fat than hard cheese such as cheddar).

When toasted in the skillet, the tortillas brown and crisp and the cheese melts and fuses with the vegetables for a fast-cooked meal that begs to be devoured immediately.
