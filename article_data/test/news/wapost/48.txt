My insurance doesn’t cover therapy, so I’m talking to an astrologer instead
The irony, of course, was that I needed therapy more than ever before in my life. So much of my identity was wrapped up in my job, that I had no idea what to do once I didn’t have that thing to define myself anymore. I started retreating within myself, because I didn’t want to talk to people about my lack of work or my stress-inducing financial situation. I cried in hotel lobbies, on the subway, in public bathrooms and in coffee shops. I stopped eating, out of some insane fear that I’d eventually go hungry. I was at the lowest point of my life, and I had no one to talk to about it, because I couldn’t afford the therapist I desperately needed.
