Redskins rookie minicamp: Five things to watch when the action begins Friday

The Washington Redskins have been lauded with praise since putting together what is thought to be a strong draft class last month. The organization grabbed the top run-stopper in the draft and arguably the second-best running back, traded for a third-round pick it didn’t have and added depth at offensive line and throughout the defense.

Rookie minicamp begins Friday as the 2018 draft class gets its first taste of live action wearing the team’s colors. The three-day session is held over the weekend with organized team activities (better known as OTAs) starting May 22.

The Redskins finished 2017 with a 7-9 record and are expected to improve by simply being healthy after 23 players ended the season on injured reserve. First-round defensive tackle Da’Ron Payne and second-round running back Derrius Guice are expected to immediately impact the team’s two biggest weaknesses – stopping the run and running the ball.

Here are five things to watch this weekend:

Is the Guice hype real?

The freefall of LSU running back Guice dominated the conversation, but the Redskins were able to get the first-round talent at No. 59 overall. The 5-foot-11, 224-pounder was the seventh running back off the board after widely being considered the second-best rusher behind Saquon Barkley. So far, uncorroborated rumors of character concerns appear to have caused the drop and now Guice has something to prove.

The early thought for Redskins Coach Jay Gruden is to use him on first and second downs, while using speedy pass-catching Chris Thompson in third-down situations. Guice looks up to Marshawn Lynch and compares his running style to the man known as Beast Mode. The organization is counting on LSU’s No. 5 all-time rusher (3,074 yards in college) to help a woeful running game that ranked 28th in the league last season.

Can Payne rush the passer?

The Redskins made Payne the No. 13 overall pick and it’ll be a disappointment if he’s not starting in the middle of the defensive line from Day 1. The Alabama strongman was the top run-stopper in the draft, but some analysts questioned his pass-rush ability and consistency. Washington had the worse run defense in the league last season and if Payne can improve that rank, eat up blockers and allow the linebackers to run clean behind him, then the selection will be a success. The 6-3, 311-pound Payne has the chance to be special if he can also affect opposing quarterbacks.

Is Quin Blanding a diamond in the rough?

The Redskins signed Virginia safety Quin Blanding as an undrafted free agent after he was not selected in the draft. Blanding (6-2, 207) was first-team all-ACC player the last two seasons and a third-team AP all-American in 2017. He ranked second on the team with 137 tackles and tied for a team-high in interceptions with four. There are few questions about his production and football savvy, but his lack of high-end athleticism seemed to cause Blanding undrafted status. Washington may have gotten a steal if Blanding can continue to produce against a higher level of competition despite some limited athleticism.

Is Troy Apke more than pure speed?

There was some surprise that Penn State defensive back Troy Apke went off the board before teammate Marcus Allen. Apke, though, brings top-end speed to the field and ran the second-fastest 40-yard dash (4.34 seconds) among defensive backs at the NFL combine. The fourth-round pick was recruited to Penn State as a receiver before switching sides, so he should bring some strong ball skills to the field.

“He’s got great range,” Gruden said after the draft. “You’ve seen him fill in run support and I think he’s going to get better and better. I think the sky’s the limit for him as a player.”

Can Tim Settle get in the rotation quickly?

The selection of Tim Settle in the fifth-round was one of the reasons the Redskins recveived good grades on many post-draft report cards. The 6-3, 329-pound Virginia Tech product brings another big body to the defensive line and Gruden said they were “very surprised” he was still around that late. NFL.com placed a second-to-third round grade on Settle before the draft. Those are the kind of players that get into the rotation early in their careers.

Upgrading the defensive line was a clear offseason priority and the selection of Payne was a step in that direction. Settle could also have an immediate impact if he plays like a second-rounder.

“He’s a big, wide body, has good feet, good short-area quickness, plays off blocks well,” Gruden said after the draft. “He’s disruptive in the passing game and I think can play multiple spots along the defensive line.

“So, it’s very important to have versatile defensive lineman and have a lot of big guys that can do multiple things and he’ll add to the mix.”
