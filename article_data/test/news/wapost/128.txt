A District man was sentenced to 20 years in prison Wednesday for a fatal shooting following an argument at a cookout and fish fry.

According to prosecutors, Miller got into an argument with a woman who was with Warren at the cookout in the 1200 block of 18th Place NE. Warren tried to break up the argument, but failed.

As the fighting between the woman and Miller escalated, Warren fired several shots at Miller, as Miller tried to run. Then, according to prosecutors, as Miller fell to the ground, Warren stood over him and fired additional shots into Millerâ€™s body. An autopsy revealed Miller was shot eight times.

Warren was arrested about two months later. In February, he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.
