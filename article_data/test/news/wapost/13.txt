‘Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it’: Trump weighs in on whether he’s deserving of a Nobel Peace Prize
President Trump said Wednesday that “everyone” thinks he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to rid North Korea of nuclear weapons — but added that it’s not something he would say out loud.

Trump was asked by a reporter at the White House if he’s deserving of the prize after news broke Wednesday that three American men who had been imprisoned by North Korea were on their way home to the United States.

“Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,” said Trump, who is preparing to meet face-to-face with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in coming weeks, as part of a bid to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.

“You know what I want to do?” Trump said to reporters. “I want to get it finished. The prize I want is victory for the world — not for even here — I want victory for the world. Because that’s what we’re talking about, so that’s the only prize I want.”

Talk about Trump’s worthiness of the prize has swelled in conservative circles, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in gave life to the notion last week as well.

“President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize,” Moon told local reporters. “The only thing we need is peace.”

It was mere months ago that Trump threatened “fire and fury” and to “totally destroy” North Korea if the rogue nation threatened the United States.

Trump said Wednesday that he is hopeful his meeting with Kim — whom he not long ago was mocking as “Little Rocket Man” — will be successful.

He said the logistics of the meeting should be announced within three days and ruled out a summit in the demilitarized zone with South Korea, an idea he floated last week.
