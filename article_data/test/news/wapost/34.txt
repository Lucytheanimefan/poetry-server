The Democratic establishment shows its strength where it most needs it
The Democratic establishment is alive and well, thriving after big wins last fall that have continued through this early political season.

In Tuesday’s primaries, Democratic candidates favored by party leaders advanced to the general election in every key House, Senate and gubernatorial race on the ballot.

Perhaps nothing summed up the environment more than Richard Cordray’s romp to the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Ohio. Cordray used his ties to former president Barack Obama, who appointed him in 2012 as a consumer advocate against banks, to defeat liberal Dennis Kucinich by a nearly 3-to-1 margin, despite questions about his record on gun rights.

Part of the establishment’s strength comes from the party’s movement to the left on some core economic issues, co-opting potential primary challenges from the left. Cordray overcame doubts about his past A rating from the National Rifle Association, as a state official, through his aggressive record as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

In the Senate, Democrats in Washington have essentially cleared the field in every remotely competitive race this fall, including several GOP-held seats where the party hopes to win and tip the majority in its direction. While they face an uphill battle for the chamber, defending 26 seats to Republicans’ nine, they point to a lack of damaging primary battles as an advantage as campaigns move from primaries to the general election.

On Tuesday, two Democrats without ideologically pure voting records advanced without much friction: Centrist Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana won renomination uncontested, and Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia won by 40 percentage points. They are among the small group of Democrats who supported a rollback of some Obama-era Wall Street regulations and voted for some of President Trump’s nominees, including Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, but have so far faced only minor anti-establishment blowback.

A bill with bipartisan support is laying bare divisions among Senate Democrats

The most bitter primaries are happening in House races, where a flood of candidates have been motivated by the energy of liberal protests against Trump. Several of them are shaping up as ideological battles that echo the 2016 Democratic presidential primary between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), but party strategists suggest most of them just pit a glut of candidates in a primary and have no clear front-runner.

Particularly in California, this may mean Democrats do not field the establishment-backed candidate and lose some opportunities to pick up Republican-held seats.

Evidence is mounting that Democrats are more unified than Republicans. The first big indicator came last year in the Virginia gubernatorial elections, when the focus was on a Clinton-Sanders style primary.

Ralph Northam, the more moderate personality backed by senior party leaders, ended up blowing out Tom Perriello in the Democratic primary as Republican Ed Gillespie barely survived his GOP primary against an underfunded challenger. Despite deep progressive angst about the Democratic nominee’s laconic style, Northam thumped Gillespie in the general election and brought coattails that led to big down-ballot gains.

The Gillespie campaign should have served as a canary in the Republican coal mine of future troubles for figures with ties to GOP leaders in Washington.

Take Tuesday’s primary results across four states. Two House Republicans from Indiana finished a distant second and third in their bid for the Senate nomination to challenge Donnelly. A House Republican in West Virginia lost in his bid for the Senate nomination to a state attorney general who last decade was a pharmaceutical lobbyist from New Jersey.

In North Carolina, Rep. Robert Pittenger (R) lost his primary to a perennial conservative challenger. And in central Ohio, a tea-party-style insurgent came within a few hundred votes of defeating the handpicked favorite of the recently retired Republican congressman, Patrick J. Tiberi, a close ally of House leadership.

While Democrats have largely avoided intraparty fights in big races, Republicans have deep concerns about potentially bitter primaries for statewide offices in Wisconsin, Arizona and Florida that fall in the late summer, with little time to unify ranks afterward for November.

“One of the hard parts is, some of them are very late. And obviously we’ve got to nominate people who can get elected in general elections,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), the No. 2 GOP leader.

The new Republican model: strong defenders of President Trump

The good news Tuesday for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Trump was the third-place finish of Don Blankenship, former coal executive who had spent a year in prison for violating safety regulations after a deadly mine disaster. He ran his campaign almost entirely against McConnell as an establishment figure, but allies of McConnell poured money into an anti-Blankenship campaign with Trump’s support.

They are left with state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey as nominee against Manchin. He is better for Republicans than Blankenship, but Democrats clearly view Morrisey as the better matchup than Rep. Evan Jenkins. Morrisey’s career as a Washington lobbyist, in an opioid-ravaged state, might neutralize Manchin’s biggest weakness, his own family’s ties to the pharmaceutical industry.

In Indiana, Republicans have Mike Braun, a distribution company chief executive, as their Senate nominee after he embarrassed the original front-runners, Reps. Luke Messer and Todd Rokita, as creatures of Washington.

Contrast that with how Democrats have handled their Senate races.

“We have 26 members up, I don’t know of any really serious primary in any of them,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Van Hollen allowed for the California Senate race, where the incumbent, Dianne Feinstein (D), is facing a challenge from the state Senate Democratic leader, Kevin de Leon.

“I will predict here that she wins by a strong margin,” Van Hollen said.

Democrats had pushed potential anti-establishment challengers out of the way in Arizona, Nevada and Tennessee, seats held by Republicans that, if won by Democrats, could flip the majority.

Even in their longer shot races, Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) had an easy primary victory to face Sen. Ted Cruz (R), and former representative Mike Espy has an open field to the Democratic Party’s nomination in Mississippi as Republicans are engaged in a bitter, ideological contest.

There are tough primaries ahead for the Democrats, particularly in House races, but with less than six months till the general election, they continue to be the much more unified party.
