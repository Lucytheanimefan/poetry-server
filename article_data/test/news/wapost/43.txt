Valerie Jarrett and Tina Tchen tried to be ‘one of the guys.’ It didn’t always work when they got pregnant.
Both women are attorneys whose career paths’ led them to the Obama White House, where Jarrett served as senior adviser to the president, and Tchen worked as Michelle Obama’s chief of staff. The women remain powerhouses: Jarrett continues to work with the Obamas as they build their foundation, and Tchen is busy leading Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund.
