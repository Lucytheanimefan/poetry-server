So what if you’re becoming your mom? This Mother’s Day, we’re celebrating their best qualities.
“As I’ve gotten older, I have been able to appreciate how much of a rebel my mom is and how she has said ‘no’ to so many traditional paths in her life. She paved her own way as the first woman in her family to pursue higher education, to leave Thailand, to live in the United States and to not get married or have kids until she was ready. She has lived her life on her own terms and has balanced it all out with a spirit of quirkiness and humor.”
