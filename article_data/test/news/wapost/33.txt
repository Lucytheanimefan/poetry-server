Valerie Jarrett and Tina Tchen on pregnancy, professionalism and potty breaks
They hail from Chicago. They were two of the most powerful women inside the Obama White House. And Tina Tchen and Valerie Jarrett are both working single parents.

They don’t mind talking about it, either. Acknowledging that women can be professionals and mothers — and encouraging women to be their “whole selves” — is part of the reason both Jarrett and Tchen have spent their careers advocating for them.

At the White House, Jarrett was one of President Obama’s most trusted advisers. Tchen was former first lady Michelle Obama’s chief of staff and is now leading the charge on the Time’s Up legal defense fund.
