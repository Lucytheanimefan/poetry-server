Here’s how this Kilauea volcano eruption compares to past lava flows

Here’s the thing about volcano eruptions: It’s really hard to tell exactly when they’ll start, and equally — if not more difficult — to predict when they will be over. And that’s what scientists are saying about the ongoing eruption on Hawaii’s Big Island.

“We don’t have a good idea of how big it is and how long it’ll last,” Tracy Gregg, a geologist who has worked on Kilauea, told The Washington Post. “It could be a couple of days, a couple of weeks. It could be a couple of months. We just have to wait and see.”

Past lava flows from this region suggest the same; they range from days to months and have ejected billions of cubic feet of lava in the process.

2014 — Slow-motion Pu’u ‘O’o lava flow spares Pahoa

The most recent significant lava flow from the East Rift Zone started in late June 2014, when new vents opened up on the northeast side of the Pu’u ‘O’o lava cone.

For months, the town of Pahoa watched as the lava crept closer and closer. Lava flowed in and out of cracks in the ground, submerging and resurfacing along a 10-mile-long path to the outskirts of Pahoa village. It stopped just short of destroying a waste-recycling center there, but continued to be minimally active until early March 2015.

1960 — A tragic case of volcano-meets-civilization

Just like the current eruption, the summit lava lake filled and overflowed in the months leading up to the eruption. Several earthquakes in late 1959 suggested that lava was flowing underground, ready to explode to the surface. On Jan. 12, more than 1,000 earthquakes were recorded with an epicenter just north of Kapoho village. The next morning, the ground had huge cracks through the village, and people knew things had the potential to get much worse.

Hawaii Volcano Observatory scientists described Jan. 12 as “the ground beneath our feet in almost constant motion.” They also heard “low-pitched booming sounds.”

Volcanic vents opened up Jan. 14, spewing lava 330 feet into the air. The lava flow reached the ocean the next day, and in the week that followed, residents of Kapoho tried desperately to divert the lava away from the village. It was about as successful as you would imagine. They built several walls — one as tall as 15 feet — around important buildings like the school, the Coast Guard facilities, homes and a cemetery.

By Jan. 27, lava had swallowed almost all of Kapoho, plus the neighboring village of Koa’e. The 1960 East Rift eruption was the largest since 1840 at the time.

1955 — A good comparison for 2018

The 1955 eruption is probably the most similar to what’s happening now, according to researchers at the Hawaii Volcano Observatory. It consisted of 24 separate vents along the East Rift Zone and lasted three months. Nearly 4,00 acres were covered in lava, including main roadways, sugar cane fields and residential neighborhoods.

1840 — The largest East Rift eruption we know of

The 1840 eruption along the East Rift Zone was the largest we have record of, in that the lava field generated by it is still visible. Scientists used chemical dating techniques to determine when the lava erupted. Scientists estimate that when the eruption was finished, more than 7 billion cubic feet of lava had poured out from the ground — enough to fill around 35 NFL football stadiums.

Titus Coan, a Christian missionary from New England, arrived on the Big Island just in time for the incredible eruption. An entire chapter of Coan’s “Life in Hawaii” is dedicated to it:
