Color of Money Live: What makes a great Mother's Day?
Michelle, I have recently retired meaning 3 months ago. So I read with great interest all your columns on retirement. For instance your last column about retirement ruining your marriage. My spouse has been retired for a while and doing her own thing while I was busy at work. She has hit her retirement groove. I am still trying to find my retirement groove. My retirement date was decided 1 year in advance so I had been trying on many retirement type activities. What I found to date is stuff that I was happy doing for a day or two but not any longer than that. So I keep looking for the groove. I will get there. Now for the testimonial. Financially we appear to be set. I am one of those 401k fortunate. OK. I also opened an IRA a long time ago and contributed. My kids and my wife use to accuse me of being cheap when they were growing up. Now the kids are adults and very happy that mom and dad have retirement money. As far as health insurance, I have medicare and the VA. My wife will have a Plan C with a major HMO. I had long thoughts and consulting many financial people on how to set up my retirement monies. What I have now is a 55/45 balance in equities/bonds, an annuity that we will collect in October and started Soc Sec last month. Plus about 20% of my principal is in monthly income producing mutual funds. So between the SS, the mutual funds and the annuity, I will not have to touch the principal for hopefully a good long time. I have Roth IRA’s for any big emergency. (Tax free withdrawals plus no requirement minimum distributions when I hit 70.) The one thing that I would change? I would put more into a Roth IRA and less into a traditional one. But then when I started Roth IRA’s did not exist. So we are good!
