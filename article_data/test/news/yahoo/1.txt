Democrats, pinning hopes on Mueller, push back at Pence on ending probe
Democrats convinced that special counsel Robert Mueller is on the path to taking down President Trump reacted with shock and indignation to Vice President Mike Pence’s call Thursday for the investigation to be wrapped up quickly.

As Mueller’s investigation continues to turn up evidence into ties between the Russian government and Trump’s presidential campaign, as well as possible obstruction of justice stemming from the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, Democrats have increasingly cheered it on, while Republicans have grown bolder in calling for its end.

In an interview Thursday with NBC’s Andrea Mitchell, Pence joined the growing chorus of those in his party.

“In the interest of the country, I think it’s time to wrap it up,” Pence said. “I would very respectfully encourage the special counsel and his team to bring their work to completion.”

Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., summed up the Democratic response to that idea.

“Extremely irresponsible, for somebody who should know better, to try and influence the special counsel’s campaign,” Swalwell told Mitchell. “They’re still counting Russians. Under every rock you pick up, out of every tree that you shake, a Russian falls out. So they’re still counting Russians. There’s also just a failure to come clean. You’ve seen guilty pleas now from Mike Flynn, from George Papadopoulos, from Rick Gates. So when you lie, the investigation takes longer, and then the president is still screwing around with whether or not he’ll sit down in the special counsel’s witness chair. He’s been provided the questions. He could move this thing along a lot faster if he’d just sit down and cooperate.”

Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, had even harsher words for Pence.

“VP Pence has now brought his sycophancy to a whole new level,” Schiff tweeted. “With questions concerning which senior transition officials were aware of Flynn’s secret talks w/ Russian Ambassador still unanswered and new revelations every day, investigation must continue without his interference.”

Of course, no one is more hostile to Mueller’s investigation than Trump himself, who regularly posits justifications for shuttering it, as he did earlier this week.

Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2018

There’s almost no chance that Mueller will wrap up his investigation before the midterm elections, which puts the ball in Trump’s court, and that has many Democrats worried that he’ll move to quash the probe.

“I think it would be a constitutional crisis, but let’s hope that he does not. The three things that could happen: The president could let the investigation proceed, which Republicans in the Senate, at least, are encouraging him to do,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a press conference on April 12. “We haven’t seen too much of that in the House. Secondly, he could fire Mueller or, third, [Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein. I think they are synonymous. They are the same thing. The firing of Rosenstein should be viewed by the public as the curtailing of the investigation, effectively firing Mueller from doing the job that he’s there to do. Since Christmas we have been prepared for the president taking such an action, hoping that he would not, but prepared if he did.”

In an impassioned speech on the Senate floor following the April 9 raid on Trump lawyer Michael Cohen’s office and residence, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer was more blunt: “Interfering with the investigation would be a disgrace.”
