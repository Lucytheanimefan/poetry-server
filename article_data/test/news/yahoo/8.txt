WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Latest on Tuesday's primaries in four states (all times local):

10:15 p.m.

West Virginia Republican Don Blankenship is conceding the Republican Senate nomination but remaining defiant until the end.

Blankenship said Tuesday that he "didn't get it done" and "failed West Virginians," but he warned that "the Republican Party needs to be careful about being hijacked."

Establishment Republicans and President Donald Trump warned voters not to back the former coal executive who spent time in federal prison for his role in a 2010 mine explosion that killed 29 miners.

Blankenship tells a group of supporters that he still believes he was railroaded and mistreated by federal prosecutors.

The nomination still hasn't been called between Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.

West Virginia Republican Don Blankenship isn't yet conceding his Senate primary bid, but he's talking like a defeated candidate.

Incomplete returns show the former coal executive and federal ex-con running third behind Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Rep. Evan Jenkins. Incumbent Sen. Joe Manchin won the Democratic primary for his seat.

Blankenship says he has "no idea" whether he lost votes because of President Donald Trump's tweet on Monday urging West Virginians to back either Morrisey or Jenkins. He says he has no plans to call Morrisey if he wins because he doesn't "know anything positive" he could say to him.

The retired coal executive was released from prison last year for his role in a mine explosion that killed 29 men. More recently, he attacked the Asian heritage of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's wife.

U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci (ruh-NAY'-see) has won the Republican primary to challenge Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio this fall.

Renacci had the backing of President Donald Trump ahead of Tuesday's five-way contest. Also in the race were Cleveland investment banker Mike Gibbons, Marysville small-business owner Melissa Ackison, Cincinnati-area financial management company founder Daniel Kiley and retired public administrator Don Elijah Eckhart, from Galloway.

Renacci started out running for governor but said he switched to the Senate race with White House encouragement after Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel (man-DEL') withdrew for personal reasons.

Gibbons is also a Trump supporter and already was in the Senate race when Renacci entered. Gibbons has sued the congressman alleging false and defamatory statements, including that Gibbons is anti-Trump.

Renacci's campaign discounted that lawsuit as "sad and desperate."

An independently wealthy businessman who largely self-financed his own campaign has beaten two sitting congressmen to become Indiana's Republican nominee for Senate.

Republican primary voters picked Mike Braun to challenge Joe Donnelly, who is considered one of the Senate's most vulnerable Democrats.

Braun ran as an outsider, blasting Reps. Todd Rokita and Luke Messer as "career politicians" who failed to follow through on campaign promises.

The multimillionaire owns Meyer Distributing, a national auto parts distribution business.

Braun has campaigned on his business background and has pledged to bring back jobs that have been outsourced overseas.

But an Associated Press review of his business record found he regularly imports goods from foreign countries and has been sued by employees in three states over unpaid wages and poor working conditions

Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine has won the Republican primary for governor, sending one of the state's best-known politicians into the fall contest to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. John Kasich (KAY'-sik).

DeWine's victory Tuesday leaves him damaged from a bitter and nasty primary in which Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor likened him to Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and questioned his loyalty to President Donald Trump.

The 71-year-old DeWine is a moderate Republican who served two terms in the U.S. Senate. But Taylor forced him to tack to the right to win the GOP nomination.

DeWine was endorsed by the Ohio Republican Party and was bolstered by his partnership with Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted (HYOO'-sted), who dropped his own governor bid to become DeWine's running mate.
