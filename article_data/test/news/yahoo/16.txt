Uber is releasing new information about Uber Air, an ambitious plan to launch a . "CBS This Morning" got the first look at the design models that will be on display at Tuesday's Uber Elevate Summit in Los Angeles.

"We think cities are going to go vertical in terms of transportation and we want to make that a reality," Dara Khosrowshahi told CBS News' Bianna Golodryga. The said their new model of an air taxi shows the company's vision for the future of transportation. It's a world where passengers request an Uber Air on their phone, then head to rooftop sky ports where the aircraft take off. "We want to create the network around those vehicles so that regular people can take these taxis in the air for longer distances when they want to avoid traffic at affordable prices," Khosrowshahi said.

Uber's chief product officer, Jeff Holden, said the program is meant to be "community friendly." He says they're still in the design phase and explained the technology works similar to a helicopter, with stacked rotors to create lift. But unlike a helicopter, the aircraft will have clusters of small propellers and run on electricity, making it quieter, more efficient and more affordable.

Although piloted at first, the goal is for the flying taxis to become autonomous. But questions remain about how they will guarantee safety. Uber also said for the program to become profitable it will need to move beyond a niche market. "One of the key tenets of this technology is for us to have four riders in each vehicle. So, essentially, the cost per ride goes down," he said. "The combination of mass market and sharing, which is really what Uber is all about, can bring this to the masses, can make it affordable for normal people."

Khosrowshahi took over a company in crisis when he replaced Travis Kalanick as CEO in August. The eight-year-old company is still not profitable.

"Ambition is what has created this company from the very beginning," Khosrowshahi said. "Part of what made this company great is that we take big, bold bets. That's part of the norms and the culture of this company and this is another big, bold bet that we think ultimately is something that the cities of the future are going to need." While Khosrowshahi is focused on the future, the company is still navigating a troubled past including a involving a self-driving Uber with a safety driver behind the wheel that killed a pedestrian. The CEO says the software that decides how the vehicle reacts to objects on the road may have played a role in that crash, but the company is waiting on the results of an NTSB investigation.

"What I'm doing is a top-to-bottom audit of our procedures, training, software, hardware, what our practices are," Khosrowshahi said. "We're not shutting it down. We want to get back on the road but we want to be safe when we get back on the road."

The company is also working to rehabilitate its image. A bombshell blogpost last year detailing a was followed by numerous lawsuits and an internal investigation that led to Kalanick's resignation.

"If it's not changed right now, then I failed. I will tell you that the company took upon itself to change. The change didn't start with me," Khosrowshahi said. "What happened in the past was deeply unpleasant and wrong but the company from a bottoms up standpoint started changing and I think it continues apace."
