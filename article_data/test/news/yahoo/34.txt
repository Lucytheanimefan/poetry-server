Monica Lewinsky says she was uninvited from 'social change' event because Bill Clinton was attending
Yeah, it's 2018 and this is still happening.

Monica Lewinsky called out a faux pas on Twitter on Wednesday after she was uninvited from an event.

The former White House intern and anti-bullying activist says she was invited to an event about social change — considering she's an ambassador for several bullying prevention organizations and a board member on another, she is an ideal guest. But when former President Bill Clinton planned to attend, Lewinsky's invitation was allegedly revoked.

According to the Huffington Post, the offender was Town & Country Magazine, which held its Philanthropy Summit on Wednesday.

The summit's speakers included Bill Clinton and Parkland survivor and gun control activist Emma Gonzalez.

"It's 2018," Lewinsky said on Twitter, "emily post would def not approve."

dear world:

Author Emily Post wrote "Emily Post's Etiquette," a book that covered everything from which fork to use at dinner to what's appropriate to discuss at the dinner table. She's also famous for saying, “A gentleman does not boast about his junk.”

Emily Post definitely would not have approved. More

And then Lewinsky called out the event's organizers, tweeting, "Please don't try to ameliorate the situation by insulting me with an offer of an article in your mag."

On Twitter people shared their support for Lewinsky after she publicized the situation. Gina McGalliard, a journalist, pointed out that it's surprising that Clinton is still invited to events in the #MeToo era.

I’m surprised people are still inviting him to things on the #metoo era. — GinaMcGalliard 🧜🏻‍♀️ (@GinaMcGalliard) May 9, 2018

And others, like Erin Gloria Ryan, a TV writer, and Andrew Shaffer, an author, said they'd choose Lewinsky over Clinton any day.

tbh I'd rather hear what you have to say almost any subject — essential consultant ;) (@morninggloria) May 9, 2018

You are invited to all of my events, Bill Clinton is not. — Andrew Shaffer (@andrewtshaffer) May 9, 2018

Clinton was served with articles of impeachment in 1998 for lying about his affair with Lewinsky, then a 22-year-old White House intern. Their relationship was revealed while Clinton was being investigated for a sexual harassment claim. Although Clinton was acquitted and served the rest of his term as president, Lewinsky's reputation was significantly damaged.

Earlier this year, Lewinsky tweeted about how she's marked Jan. 16, the date the affair essentially went public in 1998, as "the day i survived another year" and asked fellow survivors to retweet if they "survived the unimaginable" too.
