Trump says he wants 'victory for the world' more than a Nobel Prize
WASHINGTON—President Trump told reporters that “everyone thinks” he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on an agreement with North Korea but that he’s more interested in “victory for the world” than in honors for himself.

“Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,” Trump said, speaking to reporters before a Cabinet meeting, in response to a question by Yahoo News. “You know what I want to do? I want to get it finished. The prize I want is victory for the world, not for even here. I want victory for the world, because that’s what we’re talking about. So, that’s the only prize I want.”

At least 18 Republican members of Congress have nominated Trump for the prize, which was won by Barack Obama in 2009. They cited Trump’s efforts to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, which will be the subject of an upcoming summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The outcome of those negotiations is uncertain. The agreement to meet came after a series of insults and escalating threats between the two leaders, including Trump’s memorable warning of unleashing “fire and fury” on North Korea.

The deadline for nominations this year, however, was Jan. 31. The letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee was sent last week.

As part of the thaw in relations between North and South Korea, Kim met with South Korean President Moon Jae-In last month – the first summit between the two Koreas in more than a decade. Following the meeting, the pair said they wanted to continue talks and end the long-standing conflict between their nations.

At his Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Trump said a location and time for his summit with Kim had been set and would be announced “within three days.” Trump also fielded a question about whether something could “still scuttle this meeting.” He expressed optimism that it would go forward.

“Everything can be scuttled. Everything can be scuttled. … Lot of things can happen, lot of good things can happen, lot of bad things can happen. I believe that we have — both sides want to negotiate a deal,” said Trump.

Trump also predicted the agreement would be a good one.

“I think it’s going to be a very successful deal. I think we have a really good shot at making it successful, but lots of things can happen. And, of course, you’ll be the first to know about it if it does. But I think we have a really good chance to make a great deal for the world,” he said.

At the meeting, Yahoo News also asked Trump whether he plans to ban reporters from the White House. Earlier in the day Trump had tweeted a complaint that “91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake) . . . Take away credentials?”

The Fake News is working overtime. Just reported that, despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy & all things else, 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake). Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 9, 2018

Trump did not answer the question.

“Thank you,” he said.
