Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Are Reportedly Going to Be Next-Door Neighbors with Prince William and Kate Middleton
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are about to become next-door neighbors with Prince William and Kate Middleton. The Daily Mail reported on Tuesday that the royal couple, who will be married next Saturday, will move in right next to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's Kensington Palace apartment as soon as renovations finish. Although the unit is called "Apartment 1," the label really only applies in name only. After all, most apartments don't have 21 rooms, count itself as a wing of the palace, and boast the Duke of Gloucester as a past occupant.

According to the Daily Mail, renovations are almost done on the residence, which will be linked to Prince William and Kate Middleton's Apartment 1A by adjoining doors. In the meantime, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are living in the prince's two-bedroom bachelor pad, Nottingham Cottage, on the palace grounds, where Prince William and Kate Middleton have also lived before. Right now, their neighbors are Princess Eugenie and her fianc√©, Jack Brooksbank, who were reported to have moved into the nearby Ivy Cottage last week.

If the Daily Mail's reports are true, then that means Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have two houses to explore after they get married. As Architectural Digest reported previously, royal experts predict that Queen Elizabeth II will give the couple York Cottage, an estate near Prince William and Kate Middleton's country estate in Norfolk, as a wedding gift.
