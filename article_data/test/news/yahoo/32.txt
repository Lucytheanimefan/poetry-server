Prince Charles Weighs in on the Royal Wedding
From Town & Country

The royal wedding is quickly approaching, but the father of the groom clearly isn't sweating the details. Both Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, are on a tour of France and Greece this week.

While visiting the flower market in Nice earlier today, Charles weighed in on the upcoming nuptials.

When asked how he was feeling about his son Prince Harry's marriage to Meghan Markle, he reportedly said, “Obviously marvelous. I’m sure it will be a very special day for everybody.”

According to royal correspondent Richard Palmer, the Prince of Wales and his wife Camilla called Meghan "a great girl."

ITV also reports that Camilla said she "can't wait" for May 19, and when asked about the birth of Prince Louis, she said, "It’s all very exciting." She later added, "More to go too. A few more babies to go, Zara has got a baby coming."



Charles and Camilla have both spent time with Louis in the weeks after his birth, and there's no doubt that Harry and Meghan's wedding will bring back happy memories for the couple as well. They tied the knot in Windsor back in 2011, though they had a civil ceremony at the town guild hall, followed by a blessing in St. George's Chapel.

After their morning in France, Prince Charles and Camilla have already jetted off to Athens, where they will continue their tour by meeting with the President of Greece. Before his trip, Charles reportedly said, "Greece is in my blood," a reference to his father, Prince Philip's Greek heritage. They'll return home to the U.K. later this week, with plenty of time to prepare for the royal wedding.
