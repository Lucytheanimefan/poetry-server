Kris Bryant tried to start a tickle fight with Starlin Castro while a brawl was brewing
On Tuesday night, the Chicago Cubs and the Miami Marlins faced off at Wrigley Field. In the fourth inning, the benches cleared, and Kris Bryant decided that getting into someone’s face and beefing wasn’t what he wanted to do. Instead, he tried to start a tickle fight with his former teammate Starlin Castro.

The benches didn’t clear randomly, of course. It happened over a collision at home plate. Derek Dietrich was sent from second to home when Lewis Brinson hit a flare to right field. It was a bad, bad send, because the ball beat Dietrich to home plate by a mile, and Cubs catcher Victor Caratini was waiting when Dietrich got there. The two slammed into each other, though neither fell down, and Dietrich immediately got into Caratini’s face for essentially just doing his job.

That’s when the benches cleared. Neither Bryant or Castro were part of it, but when benches empty, everyone has to come out and do something. And Bryant decided that it was the perfect time to tickle his good friend Starlin.

It was adorable. (Especially since no punches were thrown and everyone just went back to their respective dugouts and bullpens.) Friends are still friends, even when they’re on different teams. And friends start tickle fights. That’s just a fact.

If only every brawl in MLB ended in tickle fighting instead of actual punches being thrown. If MLB is serious about wanting to draw more fans, they should consider making that a rule in the next collective bargaining agreement.
