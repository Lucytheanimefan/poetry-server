Kilauea Eruption: Five Other Volcanoes That Could Explode Next
The destructive eruption of the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island has captured the attention of people around the world. The volcano’s flowing lava has forced at least 1,700 residents to flee and has destroyed at least 35 structures, including 26 homes.

The Hawaii Civil Defense reported a total of 12 fissures have been formed and has pleaded with tourists to avoid the Leilani Estates. Kilauea’s eruption on Thursday prompted frequent earthquakes, including a 6.9 magnitude quake on Friday.

Before erupting last week, Kilauea volcano had been spewing basaltic lava nearly continuously for 35 years, according to Popular Science.

Kirishima volcano, one of the most active in Japan, is actually a group of 18 young, small stratovolcanoes north of Kagoshima Bay. A 2011 eruption at one of the volcanic cones, Shinmoedake, was the largest at Kirishima in more than half a century, according to Popular Science.

The super active Sinmoedake last erupted on March 1 and continued to erupt for several days. The Japan Times reported several dozen flights were canceled after it shot smoke and ash into the air.

The Villarrica volcano, which is also known by its Mapuche name Racapillan or “Pillan’s house,” is one of a few volcanoes around the world that has an active lava lake. In March 2017, Villarrica volcano gave a group of tourists quite the scare when it began to spew lava and fire into the air, according to The Daily Mail. The minor eruption did not harm anyone in the group.

Popular Science has reported that an increase in seismic and lava lake activity has been recorded since the middle of November 2017.
