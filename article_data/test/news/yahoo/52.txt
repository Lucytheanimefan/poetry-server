Stephen Colbert Blasts Trump on Iran Deal: 'You Literally Just Backed Out of an American Promise'
“Well, after years of saying he was going to do it,” Stephen Colbert noted during his Tuesday night monologue on The Late Show, “he did it.”

Earlier in the day, President Donald Trump had announced that the U.S. would be withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, saying “when I make promises, I keep them.”

“What are you talking about?” was Colbert’s response. “What are you talking about? You literally just backed out of an American promise. That’s like saying I’m not longer denying my alcoholism, let’s drink to that.”

The Late Show host then went on to compare Trump’s reasoning on the deal to that of a “bad step-parent.” After Trump said that Iran was able to continue enriching uranium while the deal was in effect, Colbert commented: “With these restrictions Iran could possibly, eventually develop a nuke and the solution is to lift the restrictions so they can start immediately?”

“That’s what a bad step-parent does. 'Look buddy, I know your old dad looked the other way when you went out and partied with your friend but I am zero tolerance, you are grounded mister, from now on you and your friends are locked in the basement with the liquor and the weed.’”

Colbert then went on to further his sharp criticism of former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who caused a stir last week when, after joining the president’s legal team, he suggested during an interview with Sean Hannity that Trump had known about a payment made by his lawyer to the adult actress Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels.

On reports that Trump was looking to stop Giuliani’s constant TV appearances, Colbert said: “Great idea, somebody should get that guy off TV… a week ago.”
